## E-Commerce
> “the delivery of information, products, services and payments by telephone, computer or other automated media” largest percentage of transactions are from business to business

- this is not just the internet
- E-retailing is supply of tangible goods, supply of “electronic goods” or
supply of services

### Contract Issues
- Accepting - web wrap (click wrap vs. browse wrap)
	- selling online, risk management tool
	- "accepting these terms and conditions" -> you are adding these terms and conditions to your offer
	- click wrap: makes you click through the terms and conditions to accept
	- browse wrap: gives you the choice, you are not forced to read the terms and conditions before accepting them
- Capacity issues
	- we don't know who is on the other side of the computer
	- a person without the capacity, e.g. a minor
- Proof-evidentiary issues
	- usually there is a lack of evidence -> consumer protection rule
	- offer screen disappears -> often what you get back is a confirmation number, so ecommerce company need to send the customer an uneditable copy (a pdf) of the offer
- International jurisdiction issues
	- you don't know where the vendor is / host of the website is located
	- you are buying in Ontario but from California -> location should be indicated in the terms and conditions
- Proper law of the contract
- Amending your contract online
	- your job as the consumer to check the updated terms and conditions
	- Kanitz v. Rogers Cable 
		- Rogers: consumers cannot join class action to sue Rogers, need to individual arbitration
		- Consumer protection act: every consumer has access to court, join class action

### E-Commerce Act
- Laws of contract apply but prior to legislation difficult adapting basic rules
- Came into force in October 2000 (ONT)
- tries to bridge the gap between old rules and new format
	- e.g. signature now includes digital signature, communication can be electronice, and acceptance can be clicking an icon

### Legislation
- E-commerce act
	- rules of contract formation that apply to all internet contracts - oaci
- Consumer Protection Act
	- protections available to consumers when they contract with a business online - copies (the business should send a copy of the contract, otherwise, the consumer can terminate immediately), disclosure, cooling off (cooling off period during which a consumer can get out)
	- this is why international jurisdiction is important

### Tort Issues
- Negligent Misrepresentation - duty - *size of the victim pool* (new!)
	- things you can do on your website:
		- testimonials, great things about your business
		- cannot put inflated comments / fake testimonials
		- tax information you put on your website to show off your skills are wrong -> negligent misrepresentation
		- narrow down who the business is responsible for
- Fraud issues - deceit
- Defamation issues - hyperlinking
	- Trip advisor, rate my professor
	- nasty stuff you post on there -> not really annonymous
- Duty to protect clients information - PIPEDA and negligent security
	- once you discover the breach, did you notify/alert, or did you keep it secret?

### Intellectual Property Issues 
- (a catch phrase, like tort, that covers a lot of categories)
- **Copyright** issues - copyright act
	- artistic expressions of ideas, thoughts, feelings
	- protects **artists**
	- copyright infringement
	- collective societies & tariffs
	- Canada: life of artist + 50 years
- **Trade mark** issues
	- brands, identifying my products (e.g. patented goods)
	- **business** exclusivity
	- infringement - passing off
	- trademark act
	- cybersquatting - address or name
	- indefinite duration, if you protect them. key: exclusivity, tied to your product
- **Patent** issues
	- novels, new process = technology
		- things have outcomes, inventions that have a purpose (allows us to do something more efficiently)
		- protects **inventors**
	- infringement of patent
	- 20 year monopoly if you patent it
	- how quickly new technology gets invented -> encourage inventors

### copyright
- The right or ownership that exists in original works of authorship in
any medium of expression including literary, musical, drama …
produce, re-produce, perform, publish
- Protects expression not the idea
	- e.g. pretty woman & cinderella
		- both have the idea that a successful man rescues a poor woman
		- different expressions
- Work – published or unpublished,
	- work of art
- Exclusive right to reproduce, copy, distribute
- Life of the author plus 50 years (moral rights)
	- copyright vs moral right
	- moral right: attributed as the author (no time limit on this)
		- e.g. Shakespear is dead for more than 50 years, but you can't pretend that you wrote his work
		- you have to always give the author attribution
- Infringement remedy – damages/ injunction
- Copyright Act
- Employment
	- your employer gets the copyright of anything that you create during the course of your employment
	- if you are working on your own project/startup while working, have your boss yell at you, so you have the evidence that he cannot keep what you created
- Universities let students keep their own intellectual property
- Mickey mouse example:
	- core of Disney (merch, etc.)
	- copyright extention act: life of author + 70 years

### Exception - Fair Dealing
- Fair use for research, private study, education, parody, satire, criticism, review or news reporting
	- wider in Canada
- You tube exception
	- If not for commercial use, you can do a cover of a song, parody, etc.
- Private use copying of musical works
	- downloading music
- Analysis of fair dealing defence:
	- first is it one of the allowed purposes;
	- second is it fair given amount, purpose alternatives….
- if you are not trying to make money, it's okay

### Owner's rights
- Licence others
	- royalties - licence fee
	- collective societies
		- union/society for creators
		- lobby the regulators
	- tariffs - communication to the public - CRTC
		- tariff on a blank CD (only purpose someone buys a CD is to burn songs on it)
	- Canadian Copyright Board (31.4)
- Block others
	- TPM's and DRMS	
		- historically found inappropriate
	- Cannot bypass s.41.1 & 41.22
		- now: it is an offence to try to bypass blocks to download
	- ISP Duties to Notify
	- WIPO

### Trademarks
- Distinctive mark used to distinguish products or service
- Mark may be word, name, symbol, packaging…
- Usually not always registered – Federal / Trade Mark Act – 15 years & renew - indefinite
	- renewal can keep going
- Common law protection through Tort liability – Passing off
	- burden of prove is on you
- Confusingly similar is the issue
	- someone else uses your stuff
	- does not have to be identical
- Canadian Trademark Database
	- harvey's makes hamburger a beautiful thing
	- hamburger icons

### Patents
- 20 year monopoly
- New, useful, process
	- Novelty, utility, ingenuity
- Patent Act
	- Application process, opposition, re-examination
	- First to file priority 
	- If someone else kept it secret for many years but you recenyly filed it, you can keep your patent. However, they can stop your patent by saying that this is commonly known (publicly used for many years)
	- different patent holders in differnt countries
- Use it yourself or licence others to use it
- Manufacturing
- Business methods
- E.g. the founder - McDonald's kitchen design is a patentable design since it creates the flow of work
	- franchise licence - can include the patent of your kitcen

###	Privacy Issues
- territorial/space privacy
	- the right to not be searched/touched/etc.
	- who has the right to search my home? who has the right to search my car?
	- right to invade privacy: a warrant
	- privacy is **not** an absolute right
	- justifiable in a free society, for the public good
- PIPEDA- Personal Information Protection and Electronic
Documents Act.
	- makes sure that the data collected about you is for a certain use, not for every use: e.g. clicker grades are for calculating students' final grades only, not for using it in a professor's research. 
	- NSA v.s. Snowden (the whistleblower), NSA violating the PIPEDA rules
		- Snowden signed a non-disclosure agreement with his employer
		- safe haven
- Regulates Collection and Security of information
	- collection of customer behavior (e.g. which kind of chocolate you like)
- Requires: Prior **consent** for collection, **-**, Disclosure, Access to check accuracy
- Requires: secure storage, use and destruction
	- destruction: e.g. the right to be forgotten (recognized by the E.U., but not by Canada)
	- good reason to invade privacy -> 
- Appoint a person & policy, Tort liability for inadequate security
- GAP – no obligation to disclose owner of breach
- Tell Privacy Commissioner of breach
- Application to Employers, Suppliers, Customers
	- control what info they have, how they collect/use/destroy 
	- they must tell you when they are collecting personal information from you, and you are entitled to say no.
	- we are randomly clicking the "I accept the terms and conditions" -> this is where they tell us that they are collecting our info
	
### Canadian Anti Spam Legislation
- Electronic Marketing
	- non-electronic is **not** spam: e.g. walk door to door to promote a product, mail flyers to people whom you have the address to -> **not** spam
	- e.g. sending spam emails about your business (marketing/promotions) -> **is** spam (since this can spread malware, may cause harm to your computer)
	- you should be able to unsubscribe: any email that you get must have an unsubsribe option
- Consent (this is important!)
	- you are not allowed to send marketing/promotional emails without the consent
- Exceptions
	- unless you have done business with the customer in the past two years (within two years -> can be treated as a returning customer)
- Fines
	- businesses that use spam as a marketing 
- Civil Cause of Action
- Director's and Officer's liability
- Vicarious liability

### International Business Issues
- Too often don’t know the Jurisdiction you are doing business in.
	- Ontario is a legal jurisdiction
	- most countries (that use the same law across the country) have conflicts with other countries, but in Canada, a province's law (e.g. Quebec) is different from other provinces
- How do I carry on business internationally?
- What special issues arise?
- Which laws apply?
- Where do I sue?
- How do I collect?

### Export /Import - Contract Law Issues
- Proper Law of the Contract
- Express / Implied Intent
- Common understanding of Terminology
	- the way we use words are different 
	- contract should use international acronyms -> less room for confusion
	- Commercially accepted standard
- Currency
	- Price & payment / countertrade
- Time
- Dispute Resolution
	- arbitration (coming up)
- Choice of Forum Clauses = Jurisdiction

### Court Proceedings
- Jurisdiction – **WHERE** will the lawsuit be – Choice of Forum
	- Is there a term in the contract
	- What is the most convenient forum
	- does everyone get to sue in every country? -> then we get different, conflicting results
	- things to consider: what is the most convenient place? where do the parties live? where are the witnesses? 
	- business's criteria: where most of your customers are
- Standing – does the plaintiff have a right to start an action in the jurisdiction - **WHO**
- Choice of Law – Proper law of the contract, **WHAT** law will be applied to the dispute
- Enforcement – **HOW** to collect if no assets in jurisdiction, **recognition** of foreign judgments
	- e.g. win in Ontario, enforce in Florida

### Commercial Arbitration
- pick how you would like this to be settled, without using the court - "design on your own dispute"
- big businesses vs consumers
	- e.g. Dell laptop case
	- Ontario opposes this, cannot force "must resolve this through arbitration" clause onto individual customers since the amount($$) is usually small, not worth hiring an arbitrator for a $700 laptop
	- Business to business can have a "must resolve this through arbitration" clause
- Voluntary
- Stipulation in original contract
- Advantages:
	- Pick the arbitrator or panel – expertise 
		e.g. (an accounting balance sheet problem, pick an auditor as your arbitrator)
	- Speed / cost/ **private**
	- Agree on enforcement
	- works well if both parties believe, commit and follow
- Disadvantages:
	- No appeal, depends on agreement
	- it's expensive
	- risk for common law: law stops evolving

### International Law
- Treaties between Governments – *contract to adopt corresponding domestic legislation*
	- e.g. environmental treaties
	- sign it go home and pass a new law
	- GATT (1949 – 9 , 128) 
		- general agreement on trade and tariffs, right after WWII, learn from mistakes from the past (e.g. treatment on Germany after WWI, punished them too hard, devastated their economy, result: WWII)
		- you cannot destry someone else's economy and avoid the consequences
		- tariffs are allowed, but you cannot have levels of friends (member or no member, partner or no partenr)
		- member of GATT must treat each other equally
		- EU is a regional exception to GATT (too close to each other, you can give your regional partners a better deal)
		- world trade organization is not a treaty
			- arbitration panel of the WTO will resolve a breach of a treaty
			- take your complaint to the WTO
			- trump: tarrif, Trudeau: retaliate (this is allowed), and the retaliation does not have to be in the same category (electronic v.s. farm produce)
	- 1995 WTO – MFN, national treatment (164)
	- NAFTA – GATT regional free trade area (dispute resolution)
		- related to GATT
	- How are GATT, WTO and NAFTA related?
		- NAFTA and GATT are international trade treaties. GATT involves approximately 160 nations around the world and gives member countries goods & services “most favoured nation status”.
		- NAFTA creates a free trade zone between Canada, US & Mexico. It is an allowed exception to GATT because it is a regional trade agreement. It has its own dispute resolution process. Chapter 11 creates a civil right to damages by business.
		- WTO is the organization that took over the administration of GATT and the disputes arising under GATT in 1995.
- Statutes that apply to private sector (arising from Treaties)
	- Investment Canada Act, Canada Customs Act
	- Copyright Act, Patent Act
	- Arbitration Act
	- Recognition of Foreign Judgments Act

### Managing Foreign Investment (not important)
- Investment Canada gets notice of foreign Investment
	- looks at how much foreign investment is coming in
	- direct investment/buying businesses
- Must give approval of acquisition of large Canadian business – protect culture (often conflicts with free trade agreements)
	- deny "too big to fail"
- Tariffs set under Canada Customs Act but must respect Treaties
- Bans, quotas, licenses, red tape
- Unfair trade practices – dumping (we have an access of something, dump it into a market that we have access to), subsidy (easy to monitor)
- Countervailing duties
