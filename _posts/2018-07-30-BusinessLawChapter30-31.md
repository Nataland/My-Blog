## E-Commerce
> “the delivery of information, products, services and payments by telephone, computer or other automated media” largest percentage of transactions are from business to business
- this is not just the internet
- E-retailing is supply of tangible goods, supply of “electronic goods” or
supply of services

### Contract Issues
- Accepting - web wrap (click wrap vs. browse wrap)
	- selling online, risk management tool
	- "accepting these terms and conditions" -> you are adding these terms and conditions to your offer
	- click wrap: makes you click through the terms and conditions to accept
	- browse wrap: gives you the choice, you are not forced to read the terms and conditions before accepting them
- Capacity issues
	- we don't know who is on the other side of the computer
	- a person without the capacity, e.g. a minor
- Proof-evidentiary issues
	- usually there is a lack of evidence -> consumer protection rule
	- offer screen disappears -> often what you get back is a confirmation number, so ecommerce company need to send the customer an uneditable copy (a pdf) of the offer
- International jurisdiction issues
	- you don't know where the vendor is / host of the website is located
	- you are buying in Ontario but from California -> location should be indicated in the terms and conditions
- Proper law of the contract
- Amending your contract online
	- your job as the consumer to check the updated terms and conditions
	- Kanitz v. Rogers Cable 
		- Rogers: consumers cannot join class action to sue Rogers, need to individual arbitration
		- Consumer protection act: every consumer has access to court, join class action

### E-Commerce Act
- Laws of contract apply but prior to legislation difficult adapting basic rules
- Came into force in October 2000 (ONT)
- tries to bridge the gap between old rules and new format
	- e.g. signature now includes digital signature, communication can be electronice, and acceptance can be clicking an icon

### Legislation
- E-commerce act
	- rules of contract formation that apply to all internet contracts - oaci
- Consumer Protection Act
	- protections available to consumers when they contract with a business online - copies (the business should send a copy of the contract, otherwise, the consumer can terminate immediately), disclosure, cooling off (cooling off period during which a consumer can get out)
	- this is why international jurisdiction is important

### Tort Issues
- Negligent Misrepresentation - duty - *size of the victim pool* (new!)
	- things you can do on your website:
		- testimonials, great things about your business
		- cannot put inflated comments / fake testimonials
		- tax information you put on your website to show off your skills are wrong -> negligent misrepresentation
		- narrow down who the business is responsible for
- Fraud issues - deceit
- Defamation issues - hyperlinking
	- Trip advisor, rate my professor
	- nasty stuff you post on there -> not really annonymous
- Duty to protect clients information - PIPEDA and negligent security
	- once you discover the breach, did you notify/alert, or did you keep it secret?

### Intellectual Property Issues 
- (a catch phrase, like tort, that covers a lot of categories)
- **Copyright** issues - copyright act
	- artistic expressions of ideas, thoughts, feelings
	- protects **artists**
	- copyright infringement
	- collective societies & tariffs
	- Canada: life of artist + 50 years
- **Trade mark** issues
	- brands, identifying my products (e.g. patented goods)
	- **business** exclusivity
	- infringement - passing off
	- trademark act
	- cybersquatting - address or name
	- indefinite duration, if you protect them. key: exclusivity, tied to your product
- **Patent** issues
	- novels, new process = technology
		- things have outcomes, inventions that have a purpose (allows us to do something more efficiently)
		- protects **inventors**
	- infringement of patent
	- 20 year monopoly if you patent it
	- how quickly new technology gets invented -> encourage inventors

### copyright
- The right or ownership that exists in original works of authorship in
any medium of expression including literary, musical, drama …
produce, re-produce, perform, publish
- Protects expression not the idea
	- e.g. pretty woman & cinderella
		- both have the idea that a successful man rescues a poor woman
		- different expressions
- Work – published or unpublished,
	- work of art
- Exclusive right to reproduce, copy, distribute
- Life of the author plus 50 years (moral rights)
	- copyright vs moral right
	- moral right: attributed as the author (no time limit on this)
		- e.g. Shakespear is dead for more than 50 years, but you can't pretend that you wrote his work
		- you have to always give the author attribution
- Infringement remedy – damages/ injunction
- Copyright Act
- Employment
	- your employer gets the copyright of anything that you create during the course of your employment
	- if you are working on your own project/startup while working, have your boss yell at you, so you have the evidence that he cannot keep what you created
- Universities let students keep their own intellectual property
- Mickey mouse example:
	- core of Disney (merch, etc.)
	- copyright extention act: life of author + 70 years

### Exception - Fair Dealing
- Fair use for research, private study, education, parody, satire, criticism, review or news reporting
	- wider in Canada
- You tube exception
	- If not for commercial use, you can do a cover of a song, parody, etc.
- Private use copying of musical works
	- downloading music
- Analysis of fair dealing defence:
	- first is it one of the allowed purposes;
	- second is it fair given amount, purpose alternatives….
- if you are not trying to make money, it's okay

### Owner's rights
- Licence others
	- royalties - licence fee
	- collective societies
		- union/society for creators
		- lobby the regulators
	- tariffs - communication to the public - CRTC
		- tariff on a blank CD (only purpose someone buys a CD is to burn songs on it)
	- Canadian Copyright Board (31.4)
- Block others
	- TPM's and DRMS	
		- historically found inappropriate
	- Cannot bypass s.41.1 & 41.22
		- now: it is an offence to try to bypass blocks to download
	- ISP Duties to Notify
	- WIPO

### Trademarks
- Distinctive mark used to distinguish products or service
- Mark may be word, name, symbol, packaging…
- Usually not always registered – Federal / Trade Mark Act – 15 years & renew - indefinite
	- renewal can keep going
- Common law protection through Tort liability – Passing off
	- burden of prove is on you
- Confusingly similar is the issue
	- someone else uses your stuff
	- does not have to be identical
- Canadian Trademark Database
	- harvey's makes hamburger a beautiful thing
	- hamburger icons
