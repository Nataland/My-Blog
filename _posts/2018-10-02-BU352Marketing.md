# Week 1 - Chapter 1 and 2

Note: complete connect assignment 75% before next class

### Positioning
- the centre 
- why Jack Astors is not the same as Boston Pizza
- key: relative to competitors

### Develop Consumer Value
- Operational excellence
    - faster, more efficient
    - e.g. Walmart (bought a satellite)
- Product excellence
    - “me too” is not going to take you very far
    - need to create something unique
    - you can charge more, and people will be willing to pay for it
    - e.g. Lexus: great product quality
- Locational excellence
	- makes a huge difference because there are many options & online retailing
	- McDonald's, Tim Hortons
- Customer excellence
    - why you keep returning to your favourite restaurant
    - e.g. Costco, Nordstrom

Marketing is not about what's happened, it's about what you predict

| vis         | products and services |                    |                     |
| ----------- | --------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------- |
| **markets** |                       | current            | new                 |
|             | current               | market penetration | product development |
|             | new                   | market development | diversification     |

- **Market penetration**
  - existing target market, same product: get more people to buy more, or attract new customers within the same target market
  - take your existing products and bundle them to get someone to buy more
  - e.g. Tim Horton's Roll up the Rim
- **Product development**
  - existing target market, new product
  - develop a new product like Apple Watch
  - e.g. Tim Horton's add latte to their product line
- **Market development**
  - new target market, same product
  - develop a new market like the senior market
  - e.g. People can get a meal at Tim Horton's
- **Diversification**
  - new target market, new product
  - completely new product
  - e.g. Tim Horton's gluten free menu

Next week: target marketing: which consumers in the market are the right ones to go to

# Week 2 - Chapter 6

### Post Sink: Companywide Strategic Planning

- Setting Company Objectives and Goals
- The goal of your company is to become the number one brand for Smart Phones (SOM & Sales) by Dec 31,2021
- currently #4 behind Samsung and Apple

Marketing Objectives:

- Who are my competitors?
- Perceptual Map
- Strategy: penetration, product development, market development, diversification
- location(place)

### Target Consumers

- The most critical business concept, 100% on the midterm & final
- Once you know your target market, the only other mantra is **execution**
- Gives you a direction: who are my customers? (identifying customers) how do I talk to them?

## STP - Segmenting-targeting-positioning

Steps in Market segmentation, targeting and positioning (from top to bottom: segmentation -> targeting -> positioning)

1. take market and divide up into homogeneous segments
   - online shopping example: homogeneous groups of different sizes
   - e.g. younger people & seniors
2. describe/profile each resulting segment
   - Dove advertisement example: people who had pressure to look a certain way
   - Budweiser advertisement example: target market is women, puppies, horses, good-looking men, but did not connect
3. evaluate and then rank each segments attractiveness
4. select the most appropriate target segments
5. develop positioning for each target segment
6. develop marketing mix for each target segment

### Market segmentation 

#### Step 1: strategy or objectives

- articulate the mission and the objectives of the company's marketing strategy clearly
- consistent with firm's mission and objectives, and current situation (e.g. SWOT: strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats)

#### Step 2: segmentation bases

- **Geographic**
  - *where they live*
  - Where you should open you stores, etc. Important!!
  - *North America, Asia, Europe, Africa*
  - *Atlantic, Central, Western Canada*
- **Demographic**
  - *who they are*
  - Age, education, income, etc.
  - Most commonly used, easy to do
  - One of the worst ways you can segment the market: purchase behaviour is different from demographic
  - *Age, gender, income, occupation, ethnic, background, religion, etc.*
- **Psychographic**
  - *how they live*
  - The best one, toughist, challenging to understand, also expensive
  - The way people think typically translates into how they buy
  - Explains: why do you do what you do?
  - three components
    - **self-values**
      - life goals, overriding desires that drive how a person lives his/her life
      - self-respect, self-fulfillment, sense of belonging
      - causese people to develop self-images, how they want to be
      - e.g. Lexus: "Amazing in motion"; BMW: "Designed for friving pleasure" and "The Ultimate Driving Machine"
    - **self-concepts**
      - people's self-image: the image people have of themselves
      - what people see themselves as
      - e.g. L'Oreal: "Becasue I'm Worth It"
      - balance the ideal with the realistic
    - **lifestyles** 
      - ways we live
      - e.g. "people person", Harley way of life
  - **VALS**
    - Values and Lifestyle Survey
    - intersection of psycologym demographics, and lifestyle
    - categories
      - innovators
      - thinkers
      - believers
      - achievers
      - strivers
      - experiencers
      - makers
      - survivors
- **Behavioural**
  - *why they buy, how often, and how they plan to use the products or services*
  - The way people act
  - How loyal are they to a brand, are they a heavy user of a brand, what they normally do
  - e.g. convenience oriented customers
  - *Benefits Sought, Loyalty or Usage Patterns*
  - *Convenience, economy, prestige,*
  - *Completely loyal, not loyal, somewhat loyal*
  - **occasion segmentation**: behavioural segmentation based on when a product or service is purchased or consumed
  - **benefit segmentation**: considers the benefits consumers are looking for from products or services
    - RBC: Youth, Nexus, Borrowers/Builders, Wealth Accumulators and Wealth Preservers
    - Hollywood: comedy, romance, etc.
  - **loyalty segmentation**: investing in retention and loyalty initiatives to retain their most profitable customers
    - loyalty cards: popular in Canada, 87% participating in at least 1 loyalty program
  - **Usage rate**: heavy users, regular users, occasional users
    - restaurants use promotional coupons to target occasional visitors
    - Air Canada use "Super Elite" for frequent flyers
- **Using multiple segmentation methods**
  - geodemographic segmentation:
    - a combination of geographic, demographic, and lifestyle characteristics 
    - particularly useful for retailers because customers typically patronize stores close to their neighbourhood
    - segmentation grid: primary segment, secondary segment, and tertiary segment
  - composite segmentation:
    - benefits sought, lifestyles & demographics together
  - PSYTE Clusters
  - VALS
  - Any combination
- Describing a tarket market:
  - BMW: for performance
  - Volvo: safety, parents
  - Sunlife commercial: targeting people who dont like their jobs
- Give your target market a name (will lose marks if you don't)
  - e.g. hard-working moms
- Segmenting Business Markets - major segmentation variables
  - business demographics: industry, company size, location
  - operaing variables: technology, user/non-user status, custoemr capabilities
  - purchasing approaches: purchasing function organization, power structure, existing relationship nature, general purchase policies, purchasing criteria
  - situational factors: urgency, specific application, size of order
  - personal characteristics: buyer-seller similarity, risk attitude, loyalty

### Market targeting

#### Step 3: evaluate segment attractiveness

- **identifiable** (boolean)
  - who is in their market?
  - are the segments unique?
  - does each segment require a unique marketing mix?
  - something that's hard to measure
  - most people are identifiable
- **reachable** (boolean)
  - almost everybody is reachable
- **substantial** and **profitable** (boolean)
  - size matters ... to a point
  - too small and it can be insignificant
  - corporations: focusing energy
  - segment profitability = (segment size * segment adoption percentage * purchase behaviour * profit margin percentage) - fixed costs
- **responsive** (boolean)
  - customers must:
    - react (similarly and) positively to firm's offering
    - move toward the firms products/services
    - accept the firm's value proposition

- keep the segment if (identifiable && reachable && substantial and profitable && responsive)
- evaluating market segments
  - segment size and growth
    - % of the population
    - how many competitors does this segment have?
  - segment structural attractiveness
  - company objectives and resources

#### Step 4: select target market

- **undifferentiated marketing** or mass marketing
  - nobody uses this now
  - basic items: salt, sugar, greeting cards, but still trying to differentiate
- **differentiated marketing**
  - most mass companies
  - a few segments
  - La Senza: La Senza, La Senza Spirit, La Senza Express
  - Conde Nast: 20 niche magazines such as Vogue, The New Yorker, etc; one magazine suffering a circular decline can be offset by another magazine
- **concentrated marketing** or niche marketing
  - smaller companies, entrepreneurial start-up ventures
  -  one segment
- **customized marketing** or micromarketing
  - 1-to-1 marketing
  - when a firm tailors a product or service to suit an individual customer's wants or needs
  - based on technology: Dell and Lands' End use internet to offer custom products
  - **mass customization**
    - one-to-one basis but with many people
    - e.g. Build-a-Bear Workshop
  - balance between added perceived customer value the segmentation can offer vs its cost
- Toothpaste example
  - Sensory segment, children: flavour, appearance
  - Sociable segment, teens, young people: fresh breath
  - Warrior segment, large families: performance
  - Independent segment, men: cheap

### Market positioning

#### Step 5: identify and develop positioning strategy

- **positioning is the design and implementation of a retail mix to create an image of the retailer in the customer's mind *relative to its competitors***
- businesses must research what its image is and make sure that it is consistent with what the customer in its target want:
  - know your company inside out
  - know your consumer completely
  - know your competitors and what they can and cannot do
- positioning is the single largest influence on the buying decision
- exists in people's heads, not in your words
- (textbook) the mental picture or perception - the thoughts, feelings, and impressions - that people have about a company and its products and brands relative to competing products, brands, or companies
- **value proposition**: communicates the customer benefits to be received from a product or service and thereby provides reasons for wanting to purchase it
- not easy to shape consumers' perceptions
- helps with
  - information overload
  - simplifies evaluation

- Positioning competitively: product positioning
  - defined by consumers planned by marketers
  - "mind share" it occupies: what percentage of my mind does a brand occupy, this is exceptionally different to change. If the product is "low fat", you have to emphasize it over and over again, this is what positiong is about
  - is like Cement
- Positioning statement (refer to formula below)
  1. target market
  2. offering name or brand
  3. product/service category or concept
  4. unique point of difference/benefits

- Quick formula:
  - for (target customer)
  - who (statement of the need or opprotunity)
  - the (product name) is a (product category)
  - that (statement of key benefit - why buy)
  - unlike (primary competitive option): unlike doing it on your own/using another brand/service
  - out product (statement of key differentiation): key point, all your customer analysis goes into this statement, and the product has to be:
    - something your customer wants
    - something you do really well
    - something that is unique
- Examples:
  - (textbook) Gatorate: for \[athletes around the world] [Gatorade] is the [sports drink] that [represents the heart and soul of athleticsm]. Unlike [water], it [gives the fuel for working muscles, fluid for hydration, and electrolytes to help replace what is lost in sweat before, during, and after activity to get the most out of your body].
  - (textbook) 7-Up: for \[noncola consumers] [7-up] is a [noncaffeinated soft drink] that [is light, refreshing, lemon-lime flavoured]. Unlike [colas], it [has a crisp, bubbly, and clean taste].
  - Consider Subway sandwiches:
    - over 18 years ago, consumers told them they wanted "freash and healthy"
    - but Subway increased business but not everyone else
    - what customers really wanted: "low fat"
    - "low fat" is the thing that's unique about Subway
    - Positioning
      - **for** young urban professionals that are 21-39 years old, have average income, post secondary education, most likely married, and health conscious and desire more in life
      - **who** are looking to eat fast healthy options when eating out
      - **Subway** sandwiches is a Quick Serve restaurant
      - **that** makes fresh subs and salads
      - **unlike** grabbing a burger and fries when you're pressed for time
      - **Subway** offers freshly made low fat subs that keep you healthy and energized even on the run
- Positioning strategy: possible competitive advantages
  - value (price/qualitty)
    - common, relationship of price to quality is among the most important considerations for consumers
    - low-price: Mega Bloks, Walmart (save money, live better)
    - high-price: Lego, Patek Philippe, Hermes, Chanel, Mercedes-Benz
    - same value, less money: wireless service providers, cable/satellite TV and radio providers, electronic retailers, and department stores
    - less value, less money: WestJet, dollar stores
  - product attributes/differentiation
    - common
    - focus on product leadership, emphasizing dimensions such as innovation, quality, performance, design and reliability
    - so good (KFC)
  - benefit and symbolism
    - emphasizes the benefits of the brand as well as the pschological meaning of the brand to consumers
    - strong symbols that distinguishes it from its competition
    - because I'm worth it (Loreal)
  - against competition (I am better)
    - head-to-head against a specific competitor or an entire product/service classification on similar attributes within the target market
    - cola wars, cellphone wards
    - good for consumers, bad for businesses
    - not too close, or will risk confusing customers/face legal challenges
    - tough on grease ... soft on hands (Polmolive)
  - market leadership
    - emphasize leadership position within the industry
    - e.g. RBC Royal Bank, 
- Positioning by using perceptual mapping
  1. **determine consumers' perceptions and evaluations of the firm's product or service in relation to competitors**
     - consumer preception vs competition
     - e.g. how the consumer uses the existing product or services, what the consumer likes/dislikes
  2. **identify the market's ideal points and size** (not in Brent's powerpoint but is in the textbook)
     - use different sized ovals that correspond to the market size
  3. **identify competors' positions**
     - figure out where everybody sits
     - A&W: no hormones
     - Harveys: make "your" burger
  4. **determine consumer preferences**
     - what are the consumers looking for
     - A&W: consumers care about their health
  5. **select the position**
     - once you get it, you do not change
     - if you keep changing it, you will confuse consumers
     - what you stand for
  6. **monitor the positioning strategy**
     - markets are not stagnant
     - consumers' taste shift and competitors rect to those shifts
     - always view first 3 steps and adjust step 4
- Famoso pizza positioning (my version)
  - **for** urban-suburban pizza lovers and university/college students 
  - **who** want a casual night out in a restaurant with good environment and quality food
  - **Famoso pizza** is a casual Italian restaurant
  - **that** offers pizza and other italian food
  - **unlike** pizza pizza and dominos
  - **Famoso pizza** provides authentic, thin-crusted, freshly made pizzas and a welcoming environment for customers to dine in
- Famoso pizza positioning (prof version)

  - **for** urban, suburban, family, young and hip, 18-40-year-old, slightly skewed to females, and medium to high annual income
  - **who** are looking for an authentic neoplitan pizza experience
  - **Famoso pizza** is a sit in pizzeria
  - **that** provides excellence service and pizza options
  - **unlike** the many so called North American pizza sit in restaurants
  - **Famoso pizza** abides by standards laid out by the Associazone Verace Pizza Napoletana 1. using unique ingredients found only in Italy, 2. the original traditions of hand stretching every pizza to give an authentic experience for you and 3. authentic pizza ovens
- Communicating and delivering the chosen position
  - easier to develop than implement
  - it takes a concentrated long term effort to make positioning work
  - **consistency is key**
    - don't change it every year
    - counter example: CMA campaign
- Describe the target market of Johnson's baby shampoo:
  - demographic: parents with babies
  - geographic: Canadian market place
  - psychographic: 
  - behaviourial: could be new parents that constantly asks others for advices, people who believe in Johson's Baby
- What is the most critical business concept and why?
  - your target market!
- Repositioning a product
  - exceptionally hard
  - can make a new product instead
  - e.g. Tiffany & Co. followed a trend of "affordable luxury", reposition by expanding its product assortment to appeal more to the middle class; consequence: increased sales, but affluent customers now view Tiffany as a common brand
  - constantly reevaluate
  - **brand repositioning** (rebranding): a strategy in which marketers change a brand's focus to target new markets or realign the brand's core emphasis with changing market preferences

## Consumer buying roles and their potential impact on this product

can be the same person, or 5 roles 5 different people

- initiator
- influencers
- decider
- buyer
- user

## Consumer buying process

definitions are all from the textbook

1. **problem/need recognition** 

   - consumers recognize they have an unsatisfied need and want to go from their needy state to a different, desired state

   - **functional needs**: performance of a product or service
   - **psychological needs**: the personal gratification consumers associate with a product or service
   - remind customers of a need or create new needs

2. **information search**

   - search for information about the various options that exist to satisfy that need
   - **internal search for information**: buyer examines own memory and knowledge about the product or service, gathered through past experiences
   - **external search for information**: buyer seeks information outside his/her personal knowledge base to help make the buying decision
     - friends, family, or a salesperson
     - commercial media
   - factors affecting consumers' search processes
     - the perceived benefits vs perceived costs of search: is it worth the time and effort to search for information about a product or service? e.g. search when purchasing car but not a plastic toy car
     - the locus of control
       - **internal locus of control**: believe they have some control over the outcomes of their actions, more search activities
       - **external locus of control**: fate or other external factors control all outcomes, less search activities
     - actual or perceived risk: five types of risk associated with purchase decisions can delay or discourage a purchase
       - performance risk: the perceived danger inherent in a poorly performing product or service
       - financial risk: the risk associated with a monetary outlay and includes the initial cost of the purchase, as well as the costs of using the item or service
       - social risk: the fear that consumers suffer when they worry that other might not regard their purchases positively
       - physiological risk: safety risk, actual harm
       - psychological risk: the way people will feel if the product or service does not convey the right image

3. **evaluation of alternatives**

   - attribute sets

     - universal sets: all possible choices for a product category

       1. retrieval sets: brands or stores that can be readily brought forth from memory

       2. evoked sets: alternative brands or stores that the consumers would consider when making a purchase decision

     - evaluative criteria

     - determinant attributes: important attributes

     - consumer decision rules

   - compensatory: trade off one characteristic against another

   - noncompensatory: choose base on a subset of characteristics, regardless of the values of its other attributes

   - decision heuristics: price, brand, product presentation

4. **purchase decision**
   - conversion rate: measures how well purchase intentions are converted into purchases
   - make merchandise easy to purchase, plenty of stock, reduce actual wait time
   - low conversion rate for internet channel, online shopping cart to delay purchase decision, can alert customers when an item in their shopping cart is almost sold out or send reminder emails about items in carts they have abandoned
   - **ritual consumption**: pattern of behaviours tied to life events that affect what and how we consume
5. **postpurchase behaviour** (3 outcomes)
   - customer satisfaction (+)
     - build realistic expectations
     - demonstarte correct product use
     - stand behind the product/service by providing money-back guarantees and warranties
     - encourage customer feedback
     - periodically make contact with customers and thank them for their support
   - postpurchase dissonance (-) or buyer's remorse
     - internal conflict that arises from an inconsistency between two beliefs or between beliefs and behaviour
     - e.g. buying an expensive TV -> regret, guilt, or grave uneasiness
     - reduce dissonance: send letter to thank him and reinforce the message that consumer made a wise choice
   - customer loyalty (+)
     - develops overtime with multiple repeat purchases of the product/brand from the same marketer

The buyer decision process chart -> see below for summary

# Week 4 - Chapter 7

1. example: buying an iPhone (can answer using the following chart)

|                            | importance                                                   | explanation                                                  | what should we do? notes                                     | what should we do? example                                   |

| information search         | how do we get on the radar screen for the potential client   | internal vs external searches benefits vs risk locus of control | where do customers look when they are searching for information? - friends who have iPhones, tech blods, store, etc. | training staff, review/blog sites                            |
| evaluation of alternatives | how and what will we need to keep in mind wih this to ensure they can make a decision? | determinant attributes consumer decision rules: compensatory, noncompensatory, decision heuristics/imp | what is the most important to the consumer? make sure that the tech specs/attributes are available and provide a chart where consumers can compare this product vs other products, give this to sales people or put it on your website | know what customers will feel are important and ensure you showcase these on website, in store and materials |

on the exam, make definitive decisions on what you are going to do: e.g. review site.

make assumptions, assume it is going to work, as long as there is some logical thinking before your decisions.

2. identify and describe the 3 social factors that influence the consumer decision process. Provide an example example of how each of these might influence the purchase of the necessary products and services for a family vacation :airplane:
   1. family: family/a family member's preference
   2. reference groups: talk to someone, takes their advice: destination; a famour person
   3. culture: destination, size of travel group

## What is forecasting?

- judgement call on *demand* based on certain *criteria* over a *given period of time* for a specific product
- based on demand instead of what you are going to sell
- criteria: past sales, growth in the industry, growth in population
- next month/next quarter/next year
- for a specific product: e.g. not for the Purell:copyright: brand, but for a certain Purell product. e.g. every single product has a unique barcode

- Why is it important?
  - production
  - how many employees you need
  - financial situation, how much money you need

- how do we do it?

> You have just joined Colgate Palmolive as a new Assistant Brand Manager working on a established dishwashing liquid-Palmolive. Your manager is away and the director of marketing has asked you for the brand's forecast for next year. Palmolive has sold a consistent amount of litres over the past 5 years, except for last year. Last year the volume increased by 25% for no apparent reason!

- competitive changes (possible)
- people eat out more (possible)
- 355 ml Trial bottle (price point: $1)
  - increased distribution
- POL AB (anti-bacteria)
- POL Lemon (new scent)
- POL Ulytra (more concentrated)
- Increased advertising
- Is it likely that the increase is 25% every year? no. for 

> You just launched a new company/division for your parent firm KIDS ARE IT.

- forecasting from the ground up

**Potential Forecaset development**

**Research is needed to get a valid number**

| Canada's population                                          | 34900000 |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| Kids ages 5-9 years old                                      | 1800000  |
| Families that make over $100M                                | 20%      |
| Extrapolation of kids in HI families                         | 360000   |
| Number of HI families shopping at specialty stores           | 30%      |
| Directional number of HI kids we have access to via specialty stores | 108000   |
| Due to price/positioning we gain listings in only 40% stores (120) | 40%      |
| Number of HI kids we have directional access to now          | 43200    |
| Adoption rate for toy - kids/parents exposed that will buy it year 1 | 5%       |
| Total units consumers pick up and purchase from specialty stores year 1 | 2160     |

## Market research

The single most important reason for undertaking market research, is to **improve the quality of managerial decision-making**, reducing risk of choosing alternative courses of action. The improved decision-making ability indirectly translates into the following benefits for organizations  

- When to do research
  - When the data will be useful in a specific way
  - You can get access to the information - people will answer questions
  - **You need to make an informed decision**
  - **Need the information to help others with a decision**
- When not to do research

  - If the financial analysis is not done
  - When you want to avoid making the decision
  - Research results are not going to change the plans
  - Cheaper to try idea then research it 
  - **Cannot expand research results to market (ie. Test market)**

- Using marketing info systems to create better value
  - Marketing information system (MIS)
  - Data warehouse
  - Data mining – data is power        

#### The marketing research process

Kraft video  

1. **Defining research objective** 

   - what information is needed to answer specific research questions?
   - how should that information be obtained?
   - make sure you are going to research the right issue to address
   - there should be agreement on:
     - the current situation
     - a clear understanding of problem/opportunity
     - the questions the reserach is designed to investigate
   - poor definition happens:
     - irrelevant questions
     - questions that is unanswerable
     - already know answer

2. **Design the research plan** 

   - start from secondary data to get point and then move to primary data to get better success (in exam)

3. **Data collection process** 

   | absolute ambiguity   | uncertainty         | complete certainty    |
   | -------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------- |
   | exploratory research | conclusive research | experimental research |

   - Qualitative vs quantitative data collection
     - qualitative research techniques – subjective
       - observation 
       - in-depth interview 
       - focus group
       - social media 
         - Famoso Pizza uses social media research, know pros and cons
     - Quantitative research techniques 
       - experiments
       - survey
       - scanner 
       - panel 
   - The “best” research design 
     - There are never a single, standard, correct method of carrying out a piece if research….
     - There are many ways to tackle a problem…
     - A research method for a given problem is not like the solution to a problem in algebra 
     - It is more like a recipe for beef stroganoff; there is no one best recipe.
   - Conclusive research methods
     - descriptive
     - experimental - systematic manipulation 

4. **Analyzing data and develop insights**

   - converting *data* into *information* to expalin, predict and/or evaluate a particular situation

5. **Present action plans**
   - executive summary 
   - Body 
   - Conclusion 
   - Limitations
   - Supplements 
     - tables 
     - figure 
     - appendixes 

A complete research effect - Kit Kat Chocolate bar 

- **Issue known** - kit kat bars were losing appeal among younger consumers while remaining popular with consumers aged 25-40
- **Qualitative in-depth interviews** were conducted with younger consumers. New forms of Kit Kat bars were sampled. The interviews were followed with **focus groups**. Follwed by usage **research**.
- The introduction of the Kit Kat chunky, a single large Kit Kat bar.

**What might have helped create this product** 

- Secondary data  
- Focus group 

# Week 5

### Midterm

- study completely
- read all the questions
- plan your time
- *3 column method* (Theory - Description - Apply)
- list, describe and apply
  - answer the 5 w's when applying (Who - what - when - where - why) make the answer "colourful"
  - directly connect company when applying

### Post Sink

> A new men's clothing store is trying to determine if there is a significant market for its type of mechandise in a specific location where it is considering putting a store. Would it be most likely to use primary or secondary data, or a combination of the two, to answer this question and what examples would you suggest?

- always start with secondary data (demographic, competitors)
- also need primary research
- determine what I need to know -> what research method

### Measuring Success of Strategic Decisions

Introduction MY income statements (7 elements)

- gross sales
  - are the entire dollar amount if the item was sold at full value (list price or full retail price) for the goods sold during a given period
  - total sales figure
- customer returns and allowances (CR&A)
  - return - merchandise returned to stock for a refund/credit
    - quality control issue if there are a lot of return
    - thus a need to generate a report for returns
  - allowance - a price reduction at time of sale
    - question: why are we offering so many discounts
- net sales
  - gross sales - CR&A = net sales
- cost of goods sold
- gross margin
  - net sales - COGS = gross margin
- operating expenses
  - variable & fixed expenses
  - variable: varies directly with sales of unites
  - fixed: whether you sell 1 unit or 100 it is the same (e.g. salary, advertising, etc.)
- NIBITDA (net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) or EBITDA (earnings before ...)
  - gross margin - operating expenses = NIBITDA

|               | dollars | % of net sales* |
| ------------- | ------- | --------------- |
| Gross sales   |         |                 |
| CR&A          |         |                 |
| Net sales     |         |                 |
| COGS          |         |                 |
| Gross margin  |         |                 |
| Opearting exp |         |                 |
| NIBITDA       |         |                 |

*: for bonus!

### Business Metrics Discussion

- why is this information important?
  - gives you insight in your business
  - gives you a story (at one point in time)
  - it is not cash flow
  - look at ways to grow your top line/bottom line

|               | dollars | % of net sales |
| ------------- | ------- | -------------- |
| Gross sales   | 9435    | n/a            |
| CR&A          | 1200    | n/a            |
| Net sales     | 8235    | 100.00%        |
| COGS          | 4505    | 54.71%         |
| Gross margin  | 3730    | 45.29%         |
| Opearting exp | 800     | 9.71%          |
| NIBITDA       | 2930    | 35.58%         |

A key point to remember:

- **shift** over time ...
  - who we are
  - our financial stability
  - competitors
  - demographics
  - social norms ... etc
- look at shifts as opportunities that marketers can take advantage of

## Chapter 3

### Marketing environments

the factors and forces outside marketing's direct control that affect marketing management's ability to develop and maintain successful transactions with its target customers

- outside the control of a marketer
- impacts the ability of marketers to connect
- "work in" vs "work on" your business

#### Micro environment

- a marketer or marketing department must collaborate with others to achive results

- need to work with suppliers to drive costs out of the system but also improve quality
- supplier and market pricing trends impact the company

### Microenviroment

Competition:

- competitors - why do I care?
- competitor myopia? Pepsi is not CocaCola's only competitor

### Macroenvironment - "shift in"

- there is nothing you can do to change it, need to react
- cultural impact:
  - name and language on material
  - e.g. coke vs pop vs soda
- what cultural shifts havey ou seen over the past 20 years?
  - became more multi-cultural
  - opportunity: halal restaurant/supermarket
  - family sizes (having fewer children)
  - getting married older
  - age shift
  - income shift
  - increased life expectancy
  - ...
- 5 distinct generations (can have 5 generations at the workplace)
  - traditionalists (our grandparents): 1900-1946, build a legacy
  - baby boomers: 1947-1965, build a stellar career
  - generation X: 1966-1978, build a portable career
  - generation Y or millennials: 1979-2000, build a parallel career
  - generation Z: 1995-2009, build social "network", getting connected, learning

### Impact

- raised minimum wage
  - significant impact
  - without raising to 15: can hire more people
  - raising to 15: prices will raise, more automation, McDonald's increase of Kiosks
- the world wide economy was shocked - businesses prepare for a recession
- the Bank of Canada continues to raise its prime rate after years of decline. What effect does thi rate have on the Canadian economy?
  - value of the dollar
    - exporters & importers
    - tourism

### Social trends

- healthy living
- green
- technology
  - use the shift in technology to create a better world - with technology comes many opportunities
  - changing delivery methods shifting how business done

### Entreprenuers

- identify opportunities

- Business-to-business buying process: need recognition > product specification > request for proposal > proposal analysis and supplier selection > order specification > vendor performance assessment
- who are we selling to?
  - resellers (e.g. Amazon, Zehrs)
  - governments (the largest, why most companies want to get the business contract): infrastructure, highways, etc.
  - manufactureres: buy raw good, add to it; also buys uniforms, Mr.Clean, equipment to produce
  - institutions: printers

|                | B2B                                         | B2C                 |

## Chapter 8 Product development

### Product attributes

- quality
  - the ability of a product to perform its functions including overall durability, reliability, precision, ease of correction/repair and other valued attributes
  - two dimentions:
    - level
    - consistency:
  - fundamental difference: McDonald's burger vs the works burger
    - McDonald's: most consistent burger
    - work's: high level of quality
- Feature and Style/Design
  - form follows function!
    - form of the product follows the function it needs to perform
    - need to deliver from a functional perspective
  - people are willing to pay for products that functions the way that they are supposed to

### New Product Development

- Overview
  - 50% of all products sold today were not around 5 years ago
  - you have no choice but to innovate
  - make sure that consumers see the value
- shifty consumers
- new product development strategy
  - two sources:
    - aquisition
    - develop a new product
  - e.g. shampoo purchase vs creation
- success factors:
  - **unique superior product** (me too does not work)
- why do new products fail?
  - too small target market
  - poor design
  - low product quality
  - incorrect positioning
    - e.g. ReeseSticks, peanut butter puffs
    - need to be consistent
  - wrong price strategy
  - poor marketing communication
  - competition

### How firms develop new products

1. idea generation
   - it's a team effort
     - internal resources
     - customers
     - competitors
     - distributors and suppliers
     - entrepreneurs
2. concept testing
   - StepUp example
3. product development
   1. prototype
   2. alpha testing
   3. beta testing
4. market testing
   - test marketing
   - standard test markets
     - London Ontario 2017 Test Market - isolation
5. product launch
   - satisfaction of financial requirements
   - satisfaction of technical requirements
   - customer acceptance
6. evaluation of results
   - product life cycle

## Creative introduction - ethics vs. social responsibility

- ethics
  - set of values that guide decision making
  - only works if all employees in the company align with these values
- social responsibility
  - voluntary actions taken by a company to contribute to improving society as a whole
  - stakeholders
    - employees
      - job enrichment
      - compensation and benefits
      - opinions matter
    - consumers
      - effective campaigns
    - marketplace
      - animal testing
- a company can be one, but not necessarily the other
- nike example: socially responsible but not ethical

### What is ethics

- e.g. tell us a time where you had to choose what was right and what was easy
- Menu Foods
  - wet pet food
  - caused pets to have crystals within kidneys
  - did not recall products in time
  - largest consumer product recall ever in N.A.
  - stock price plummeted 52%
  - company went bankrupt and was purchased by several of the companies that used them to make their foods
- Tylenol
  - most successful over-the-counter product in the US with over one hundred million users
  - Johnson&Johnson
  - Cyanide poisoning
  - reaction: product immediately removed from shelves
  - **a**cknowledged, **a**pologized, **a**ssured (great way to make sure that you've actually protected yourselves)
  - assure: find a way to prevent the products from being contaminated - glue the packaging, seal the bottle
  - shareholders and consumers liked what the saw
- six tests of ethical action
  1. the publicity test: if I'd want other people to know that I've done it
  2. the moral mentor test: someone we believe in and that believes in us, what would they think if they found out
  3. the admired observer test: if you don't want someone that admires you (kids) to find out
  4. the transparency test
  5. the person in the mirror test
  6. the golden rule test

# Week 7

    - a store
    - a person
    - a place
    - an organization

  - brands reduce marketing costs
    - e.g. lululemon: no advertisements, except for opinion leaders
  - brands are assets
  - brands impact market value

- brand name selection: desirable qualities
