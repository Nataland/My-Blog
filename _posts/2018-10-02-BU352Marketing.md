## Chapter 1

(from textbook)

- satifsying customer needs and wants
- exchange: trade of things of value between the buyer and seller so that each is better off as a result

### Marketing mix decisions

- **p**roduct: creating value
  - goods
  - services
  - combination of goods and services
  - ideas
- **p**rice: transacting value
  - not always monetary, buyer give up money, time, energy in exchange for the product

- **p**lace: delivering value
  - all activities necessary to get the product from the manufacturer or producer to the right customer when that customer wants it
- **p**romotion: communicating value
  - influence potential buyers' opinions

### The four orientations of marketing

eras: product > sales > market > value-based

- **product orientation**
  - focus on developing and distributing innovative products with little concern about whether the products best satisfy customers' needs
  - "Customers can have any colour they want so long as it's black"
  - companies think about product they want to build -> try to sell it after it is developer
- **sales orientation**
  - marketing as a selling function
  - try to sell as many as possible rather than focus on making products consumers really want
  - personal selling
  - focus on making a sale than long-term customer relationships
  - profits from sales volume than repeat sales
- **market orientation**
  - focus on what consumers want and need before they design, make, or attempt to sell their products and services
  - "customer is king"
  - understand and respond to the needs of customers and satisfy them
  - focus on marketing: entier company
  - satisfied customers -> long-term loyal custoemrs
- **value-based orientation**
  - triple bottom line: people, profits, planet
  - provide greater value than competitors
  - value: what you get for what you give
  - value cocreation: customers act as collaborators to create the product or service
  - strategy based on what its customers value
  - e.g. speed, convenience, size, accuracy, price, cost savings, or user-friendliness
  - become value driven:
    - **sharing information**: share information about custoemrs and competitors that has been collected through custoemr relationship management, and integrate it across the firm's vairous departments
    - **balancing benefits with costs**: measure the benefits that customers perceive against the cost of their offering
    - **building relationships with cutsomers**
      - relational orientation: relationship > transaction
      - customer relationship management (CRM)
    - **connecting with customers using social and mobile media**: connect better with custoemrs and thereby serve their needs more effectively

## Positioning
- the centre 
- why Jack Astors is not the same as Boston Pizza

## Develop Consumer Value
- **Operational excellence**
    - faster, more efficient operations
    - e.g. Walmart (bought a satellite)
- **Product excellence**
    - having products with high perceived value and effective branding and positioning
    - “me too” is not going to take you very far
    - need to create something unique
    - you can charge more, and people will be willing to pay for it
    - e.g. Lexus: great product quality
- **Locational excellence**
  - makes a huge difference because there are many options & online retailing
  - particularly important for retailers and service providers
  - McDonald's, Tim Hortons
- **Customer excellence**
    - why you keep returning to your favourite restaurant
    - e.g. Costco, Nordstrom
    - retaining loyal customers
    - providing outstanding customer service

Marketing is not about what's happened, it's about what you predict

## The marketing plan

1. define the business mission and objective
   - mission statement: a broad description of a firm's objectives and the scope of activities it plans to undertake
2. conduct a situation analysis
   - **SWOT analysis**
   - Nike example
     - strengths: strong brand, strong celebrity endorsers, innovative products
     - weakness: overreliance on footwear
     - opportunities: emerging countries, other fashion segments
     - threats: cheaper imports, imitation products, retail becoming price competitive
3. identify and evluate opportunities by using STP (next week)
4. implement marketing mix and allocate resources (4ps, again)
   - product and value creation
   - price and value for money
   - place and value delivery
   - promotion and value communication
5. evaluate performance by using marketing metrics

   - performance objectives and metrics
   - financial performance metrics
   - social responsibility performance metrics

## Growth strategies

| vis         | products and services |                    |                     |
| ----------- | --------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------- |
| **markets** |                       | current            | new                 |
|             | current               | market penetration | product development |
|             | new                   | market development | diversification     |

- **Market penetration**
  - existing target market, same product: get more people to buy more, or attract new customers within the same target market
  - take your existing products and bundle them to get someone to buy more
  - e.g. Tim Horton's Roll up the Rim
- **Product development**
  - existing target market, new product
  - develop a new product like Apple Watch
  - e.g. Tim Horton's add latte to their product line
- **Market development**
  - new target market, same product
  - develop a new market like the senior market
  - e.g. People can get a meal at Tim Horton's
- **Diversification**
  - new target market, new product
  - completely new product
  - e.g. Tim Horton's gluten free menu

Next week: target marketing: which consumers in the market are the right ones to go to

# Week 2 - Chapter 6

### Post Sink: Companywide Strategic Planning

- Setting Company Objectives and Goals
- The goal of your company is to become the number one brand for Smart Phones (SOM & Sales) by Dec 31,2021
- currently #4 behind Samsung and Apple

Marketing Objectives:

- Who are my competitors?

## STP - Segmenting-targeting-positioning

Steps in Market segmentation, targeting and positioning (from top to bottom: segmentation -> targeting -> positioning)

1. take market and divide up into homogeneous segments
   - online shopping example: homogeneous groups of different sizes
   - e.g. younger people & seniors
2. describe/profile each resulting segment
   - Dove advertisement example: people who had pressure to look a certain way
   - Budweiser advertisement example: target market is women, puppies, horses, good-looking men, but did not connect
3. evaluate and then rank each segments attractiveness
4. select the most appropriate target segments
5. develop positioning for each target segment
6. develop marketing mix for each target segment

### Market segmentation 

#### Step 1: strategy or objectives

- articulate the mission and the objectives of the company's marketing strategy clearly
- consistent with firm's mission and objectives, and current situation (e.g. SWOT: strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats)

#### Step 2: segmentation bases

- **Geographic**
  - *where they live*
  - Where you should open you stores, etc. Important!!
  - *North America, Asia, Europe, Africa*
  - *Atlantic, Central, Western Canada*
- **Demographic**
  - *who they are*
  - Age, education, income, etc.
  - Most commonly used, easy to do
  - One of the worst ways you can segment the market: purchase behaviour is different from demographic
  - *Age, gender, income, occupation, ethnic, background, religion, etc.*
- **Psychographic**
  - *how they live*
  - The best one, toughist, challenging to understand, also expensive
  - The way people think typically translates into how they buy
  - Explains: why do you do what you do?
  - three components
    - **self-values**
      - life goals, overriding desires that drive how a person lives his/her life
      - self-respect, self-fulfillment, sense of belonging
      - causese people to develop self-images, how they want to be
      - e.g. Lexus: "Amazing in motion"; BMW: "Designed for friving pleasure" and "The Ultimate Driving Machine"
    - **self-concepts**
      - people's self-image: the image people have of themselves
      - what people see themselves as
      - e.g. L'Oreal: "Becasue I'm Worth It"
      - balance the ideal with the realistic
    - **lifestyles** 
      - ways we live
      - e.g. "people person", Harley way of life
  - **VALS**
    - Values and Lifestyle Survey
    - intersection of psycologym demographics, and lifestyle
    - categories
      - innovators
      - thinkers
      - believers
      - achievers
      - strivers
      - experiencers
      - makers
      - survivors
- **Behavioural**
  - *why they buy, how often, and how they plan to use the products or services*
  - The way people act
  - How loyal are they to a brand, are they a heavy user of a brand, what they normally do
  - e.g. convenience oriented customers
  - *Benefits Sought, Loyalty or Usage Patterns*
  - *Convenience, economy, prestige,*
  - *Completely loyal, not loyal, somewhat loyal*
  - **occasion segmentation**: behavioural segmentation based on when a product or service is purchased or consumed
  - **benefit segmentation**: considers the benefits consumers are looking for from products or services
    - RBC: Youth, Nexus, Borrowers/Builders, Wealth Accumulators and Wealth Preservers
    - Hollywood: comedy, romance, etc.
  - **loyalty segmentation**: investing in retention and loyalty initiatives to retain their most profitable customers
    - loyalty cards: popular in Canada, 87% participating in at least 1 loyalty program
  - **Usage rate**: heavy users, regular users, occasional users
    - restaurants use promotional coupons to target occasional visitors
    - Air Canada use "Super Elite" for frequent flyers
- **Using multiple segmentation methods**
  - geodemographic segmentation:
    - a combination of geographic, demographic, and lifestyle characteristics 
    - particularly useful for retailers because customers typically patronize stores close to their neighbourhood
    - segmentation grid: primary segment, secondary segment, and tertiary segment
  - composite segmentation:
    - benefits sought, lifestyles & demographics together
  - PSYTE Clusters
  - VALS
  - Any combination
- Describing a tarket market:
  - BMW: for performance
  - Volvo: safety, parents
  - Sunlife commercial: targeting people who dont like their jobs
- Give your target market a name (will lose marks if you don't)
  - e.g. hard-working moms
- Segmenting Business Markets - major segmentation variables
  - business demographics: industry, company size, location
  - operaing variables: technology, user/non-user status, custoemr capabilities
  - purchasing approaches: purchasing function organization, power structure, existing relationship nature, general purchase policies, purchasing criteria
  - situational factors: urgency, specific application, size of order
  - personal characteristics: buyer-seller similarity, risk attitude, loyalty

### Market targeting

#### Step 3: evaluate segment attractiveness

- **identifiable** (boolean)
  - who is in their market?
  - are the segments unique?
  - does each segment require a unique marketing mix?
  - something that's hard to measure
  - most people are identifiable
- **reachable** (boolean)
  - almost everybody is reachable
- **substantial** and **profitable** (boolean)
  - size matters ... to a point
  - too small and it can be insignificant
  - corporations: focusing energy
  - segment profitability = (segment size * segment adoption percentage * purchase behaviour * profit margin percentage) - fixed costs
- **responsive** (boolean)
  - customers must:
    - react (similarly and) positively to firm's offering
    - move toward the firms products/services
    - accept the firm's value proposition

- keep the segment if (identifiable && reachable && substantial and profitable && responsive)
- evaluating market segments
  - segment size and growth
    - % of the population
    - how many competitors does this segment have?
  - segment structural attractiveness
  - company objectives and resources

#### Step 4: select target market

- **undifferentiated marketing** or mass marketing
  - nobody uses this now
  - basic items: salt, sugar, greeting cards, but still trying to differentiate
- **differentiated marketing**
  - most mass companies
  - a few segments
  - La Senza: La Senza, La Senza Spirit, La Senza Express
  - Conde Nast: 20 niche magazines such as Vogue, The New Yorker, etc; one magazine suffering a circular decline can be offset by another magazine
- **concentrated marketing** or niche marketing
  - smaller companies, entrepreneurial start-up ventures
  -  one segment
- **customized marketing** or micromarketing
  - 1-to-1 marketing
  - when a firm tailors a product or service to suit an individual customer's wants or needs
  - based on technology: Dell and Lands' End use internet to offer custom products
  - **mass customization**
    - one-to-one basis but with many people
    - e.g. Build-a-Bear Workshop
  - balance between added perceived customer value the segmentation can offer vs its cost
- Toothpaste example
  - Sensory segment, children: flavour, appearance
  - Sociable segment, teens, young people: fresh breath
  - Warrior segment, large families: performance
  - Independent segment, men: cheap

### Market positioning

#### Step 5: identify and develop positioning strategy

- **positioning is the design and implementation of a retail mix to create an image of the retailer in the customer's mind *relative to its competitors***
- businesses must research what its image is and make sure that it is consistent with what the customer in its target want:
  - know your company inside out
  - know your consumer completely
  - know your competitors and what they can and cannot do
- positioning is the single largest influence on the buying decision
- exists in people's heads, not in your words
- (textbook) the mental picture or perception - the thoughts, feelings, and impressions - that people have about a company and its products and brands relative to competing products, brands, or companies
- **value proposition**: communicates the customer benefits to be received from a product or service and thereby provides reasons for wanting to purchase it
- not easy to shape consumers' perceptions
- helps with
  - information overload
  - simplifies evaluation

- Positioning competitively: product positioning
  - defined by consumers planned by marketers
  - "mind share" it occupies: what percentage of my mind does a brand occupy, this is exceptionally different to change. If the product is "low fat", you have to emphasize it over and over again, this is what positiong is about
  - is like Cement
- Positioning statement (refer to formula below)
  1. target market
  2. offering name or brand
  3. product/service category or concept
  4. unique point of difference/benefits

- Quick formula:
  - for (target customer)
  - who (statement of the need or opprotunity)
  - the (product name) is a (product category)
  - that (statement of key benefit - why buy)
  - unlike (primary competitive option): unlike doing it on your own/using another brand/service
  - out product (statement of key differentiation): key point, all your customer analysis goes into this statement, and the product has to be:
    - something your customer wants
    - something you do really well
    - something that is unique
- Examples:
  - (textbook) Gatorate: for \[athletes around the world] [Gatorade] is the [sports drink] that [represents the heart and soul of athleticsm]. Unlike [water], it [gives the fuel for working muscles, fluid for hydration, and electrolytes to help replace what is lost in sweat before, during, and after activity to get the most out of your body].
  - (textbook) 7-Up: for \[noncola consumers] [7-up] is a [noncaffeinated soft drink] that [is light, refreshing, lemon-lime flavoured]. Unlike [colas], it [has a crisp, bubbly, and clean taste].
  - Consider Subway sandwiches:
    - over 18 years ago, consumers told them they wanted "freash and healthy"
    - but Subway increased business but not everyone else
    - what customers really wanted: "low fat"
    - "low fat" is the thing that's unique about Subway
    - Positioning
      - **for** young urban professionals that are 21-39 years old, have average income, post secondary education, most likely married, and health conscious and desire more in life
      - **who** are looking to eat fast healthy options when eating out
      - **Subway** sandwiches is a Quick Serve restaurant
      - **that** makes fresh subs and salads
      - **unlike** grabbing a burger and fries when you're pressed for time
      - **Subway** offers freshly made low fat subs that keep you healthy and energized even on the run
- Positioning strategy: possible competitive advantages
  - value (price/qualitty)
    - common, relationship of price to quality is among the most important considerations for consumers
    - low-price: Mega Bloks, Walmart (save money, live better)
    - high-price: Lego, Patek Philippe, Hermes, Chanel, Mercedes-Benz
    - same value, less money: wireless service providers, cable/satellite TV and radio providers, electronic retailers, and department stores
    - less value, less money: WestJet, dollar stores
  - product attributes/differentiation
    - common
    - focus on product leadership, emphasizing dimensions such as innovation, quality, performance, design and reliability
    - so good (KFC)
  - benefit and symbolism
    - emphasizes the benefits of the brand as well as the pschological meaning of the brand to consumers
    - strong symbols that distinguishes it from its competition
    - because I'm worth it (Loreal)
  - against competition (I am better)
    - head-to-head against a specific competitor or an entire product/service classification on similar attributes within the target market
    - cola wars, cellphone wards
    - good for consumers, bad for businesses
    - not too close, or will risk confusing customers/face legal challenges
    - tough on grease ... soft on hands (Polmolive)
  - market leadership
    - emphasize leadership position within the industry
    - e.g. RBC Royal Bank, 
- Positioning by using perceptual mapping
  1. **determine consumers' perceptions and evaluations of the firm's product or service in relation to competitors**
     - consumer preception vs competition
     - e.g. how the consumer uses the existing product or services, what the consumer likes/dislikes
  2. **identify the market's ideal points and size** (not in Brent's powerpoint but is in the textbook)
     - use different sized ovals that correspond to the market size
  3. **identify competors' positions**
     - figure out where everybody sits
     - A&W: no hormones
     - Harveys: make "your" burger
  4. **determine consumer preferences**
     - what are the consumers looking for
     - A&W: consumers care about their health
  5. **select the position**
     - once you get it, you do not change
     - if you keep changing it, you will confuse consumers
     - what you stand for
  6. **monitor the positioning strategy**
     - markets are not stagnant
     - consumers' taste shift and competitors rect to those shifts
     - always view first 3 steps and adjust step 4
- Famoso pizza positioning (my version)
  - **for** urban-suburban pizza lovers and university/college students 
  - **who** want a casual night out in a restaurant with good environment and quality food
  - **Famoso pizza** is a casual Italian restaurant
  - **that** offers pizza and other italian food
  - **unlike** pizza pizza and dominos
  - **Famoso pizza** provides authentic, thin-crusted, freshly made pizzas and a welcoming environment for customers to dine in
- Famoso pizza positioning (prof version)

  - **for** urban, suburban, family, young and hip, 18-40-year-old, slightly skewed to females, and medium to high annual income
  - **who** are looking for an authentic neoplitan pizza experience
  - **Famoso pizza** is a sit in pizzeria
  - **that** provides excellence service and pizza options
  - **unlike** the many so called North American pizza sit in restaurants
  - **Famoso pizza** abides by standards laid out by the Associazone Verace Pizza Napoletana 1. using unique ingredients found only in Italy, 2. the original traditions of hand stretching every pizza to give an authentic experience for you and 3. authentic pizza ovens
- Communicating and delivering the chosen position
  - easier to develop than implement
  - it takes a concentrated long term effort to make positioning work
  - **consistency is key**
    - don't change it every year
    - counter example: CMA campaign
- Describe the target market of Johnson's baby shampoo:
  - demographic: parents with babies
  - geographic: Canadian market place
  - psychographic: 
  - behaviourial: could be new parents that constantly asks others for advices, people who believe in Johson's Baby
- What is the most critical business concept and why?
  - your target market!
- Repositioning a product
  - exceptionally hard
  - can make a new product instead
  - e.g. Tiffany & Co. followed a trend of "affordable luxury", reposition by expanding its product assortment to appeal more to the middle class; consequence: increased sales, but affluent customers now view Tiffany as a common brand
  - constantly reevaluate
  - **brand repositioning** (rebranding): a strategy in which marketers change a brand's focus to target new markets or realign the brand's core emphasis with changing market preferences

  - **learning** - experience changes us
  - **lifestyle** - how do consumers spend their time and money to live
- **situational factors**
  - **purchase**
    - depending why you are buying it can influence how and what you buy?
    - reflecting on how this impacts a retail store ... merchandise carried - breadth and depth
  - **temporal**
    - our state of mind is critical to the purchase process
    - we need to control what we can to ensure a proper mind set
    - engage all five senses: sight, sound, smell, touch, taste
    - e.g. Safari Pet Center: an ultimate retail branding experience
  - **shopping**
    - store atmosphere
      - Apple Store
      - impact of smell on shopping behaviour: certain smells will keep you
    - sales people

## Consumer buying roles and their potential impact on this product

can be the same person, or 5 roles 5 different people

- initiator
- influencers
- decider
- buyer
- user

## Consumer buying process

definitions are all from the textbook

1. **problem/need recognition** 

   - consumers recognize they have an unsatisfied need and want to go from their needy state to a different, desired state

   - **functional needs**: performance of a product or service
   - **psychological needs**: the personal gratification consumers associate with a product or service
   - remind customers of a need or create new needs

2. **information search**

   - search for information about the various options that exist to satisfy that need
   - **internal search for information**: buyer examines own memory and knowledge about the product or service, gathered through past experiences
   - **external search for information**: buyer seeks information outside his/her personal knowledge base to help make the buying decision
     - friends, family, or a salesperson
     - commercial media
   - factors affecting consumers' search processes
     - the perceived benefits vs perceived costs of search: is it worth the time and effort to search for information about a product or service? e.g. search when purchasing car but not a plastic toy car
     - the locus of control
       - **internal locus of control**: believe they have some control over the outcomes of their actions, more search activities
       - **external locus of control**: fate or other external factors control all outcomes, less search activities
     - actual or perceived risk: five types of risk associated with purchase decisions can delay or discourage a purchase
       - performance risk: the perceived danger inherent in a poorly performing product or service
       - financial risk: the risk associated with a monetary outlay and includes the initial cost of the purchase, as well as the costs of using the item or service
       - social risk: the fear that consumers suffer when they worry that other might not regard their purchases positively
       - physiological risk: safety risk, actual harm
       - psychological risk: the way people will feel if the product or service does not convey the right image

3. **evaluation of alternatives**

   - attribute sets

     - universal sets: all possible choices for a product category

       1. retrieval sets: brands or stores that can be readily brought forth from memory

       2. evoked sets: alternative brands or stores that the consumers would consider when making a purchase decision

     - evaluative criteria

     - determinant attributes: important attributes

     - consumer decision rules

   - compensatory: trade off one characteristic against another

   - noncompensatory: choose base on a subset of characteristics, regardless of the values of its other attributes

   - decision heuristics: price, brand, product presentation

4. **purchase decision**
   - conversion rate: measures how well purchase intentions are converted into purchases
   - make merchandise easy to purchase, plenty of stock, reduce actual wait time
   - low conversion rate for internet channel, online shopping cart to delay purchase decision, can alert customers when an item in their shopping cart is almost sold out or send reminder emails about items in carts they have abandoned
   - **ritual consumption**: pattern of behaviours tied to life events that affect what and how we consume
5. **postpurchase behaviour** (3 outcomes)
   - customer satisfaction (+)
     - build realistic expectations
     - demonstarte correct product use
     - stand behind the product/service by providing money-back guarantees and warranties
     - encourage customer feedback
     - periodically make contact with customers and thank them for their support
   - postpurchase dissonance (-) or buyer's remorse
     - internal conflict that arises from an inconsistency between two beliefs or between beliefs and behaviour
     - e.g. buying an expensive TV -> regret, guilt, or grave uneasiness
     - reduce dissonance: send letter to thank him and reinforce the message that consumer made a wise choice
   - customer loyalty (+)
     - develops overtime with multiple repeat purchases of the product/brand from the same marketer

The buyer decision process chart -> see below for summary

# Week 4 - Chapter 7

1. example: buying an iPhone (can answer using the following chart)

|                            | importance                                                   | explanation                                                  | what should we do? notes                                     | what should we do? example                                   |

on the exam, make definitive decisions on what you are going to do: e.g. review site.

make assumptions, assume it is going to work, as long as there is some logical thinking before your decisions.

2. identify and describe the 3 social factors that influence the consumer decision process. Provide an example example of how each of these might influence the purchase of the necessary products and services for a family vacation :airplane:
   1. family: family/a family member's preference
   2. reference groups: talk to someone, takes their advice: destination; a famour person
   3. culture: destination, size of travel group

## What is forecasting?

- judgement call on *demand* based on certain *criteria* over a *given period of time* for a specific product
- based on demand instead of what you are going to sell
- criteria: past sales, growth in the industry, growth in population
- next month/next quarter/next year
- for a specific product: e.g. not for the Purell:copyright: brand, but for a certain Purell product. e.g. every single product has a unique barcode

- Why is it important?
  - production
  - how many employees you need
  - financial situation, how much money you need

- how do we do it?

## Market research

The single most important reason for undertaking market research, is to **improve the quality of managerial decision-making**, reducing risk of choosing alternative courses of action. The improved decision-making ability indirectly translates into the following benefits for organizations  

- When to do research
  - When the data will be useful in a specific way
  - You can get access to the information - people will answer questions
  - **You need to make an informed decision**
  - **Need the information to help others with a decision**
- When not to do research

  - If the financial analysis is not done
  - When you want to avoid making the decision
  - Research results are not going to change the plans
  - Cheaper to try idea then research it 
  - **Cannot expand research results to market (ie. Test market)**

- Using marketing info systems to create better value
  - Marketing information system (MIS)
  - Data warehouse
  - Data mining – data is power        

#### The marketing research process

Kraft video  

1. **Defining research objective** 

   - what information is needed to answer specific research questions?
   - how should that information be obtained?
   - make sure you are going to research the right issue to address
   - there should be agreement on:
     - the current situation
     - a clear understanding of problem/opportunity
     - the questions the reserach is designed to investigate
   - poor definition happens:
     - irrelevant questions
     - questions that is unanswerable
     - already know answer

2. **Design the research plan** 

   - start from secondary data to get point and then move to primary data to get better success (in exam)

3. **Data collection process** 

   | absolute ambiguity   | uncertainty         | complete certainty    |
   | -------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------- |
   | exploratory research | conclusive research | experimental research |

   - **secondary data** (pieces of information that have been collected prior to the start of the focal research project)
     - free/inexpensive (census data, reports published) or purchase from specialized research firms
     - can be accessed through internal sources
     - **internal secondary data**: cache of customer information and purchase history
       - **data mining**: variety of statistical analysis tools to uncover previously unknown patterns in the data or relationships among variables
         - reduce churn levels (= number of participants who discontinue use of a service / average number of total participants)
       - **big data**
         - popularity due to:
           1. the increase in the amounts of data companies have access too
           2. their ability to collect these data
           3. the ease of collecting and storing data
           4. the computing ability to manipulate data
           5. the access to software to convert data to insights
         - Amazon's recommendation engine
     - **external secondary data**
       - free/inexpensive (e.g. Statistics Canada's Census) vs **syndicated data** (from commercial research firms)
       - scanner data: obtained from scanner readings of UPC codes at chekcout counters and used in quantitative research
       - panel data: information collected from a group of consumers over time
   - **primary data** (data collected to address specific research needs) qualitative vs quantitative:
     - qualitative research techniques – subjective
       - **observation** 
         - ethnography: studeis people in their daily lives and activities
         - determine how consumers might use a product
       - **in-depth interview** 
         - trained researchers ask questions, listen to and record the answers, and then pose additional questions to clarify or expand on a particular issue
         - communicate how people really feel about a product or service at the individual level
         - use this to develop surveys
         - relatively expensive and time consuming
       - **focus group**
         - 8-12 people come together for an in-depth discussion about a particular topic
         - qualitative data like initial reactions, opinions about different competitive offering, reactions to marketing stimuli
       - **social media** 
         - learn about customers' likes, dislikes, and preferences
         - blogs, Facebook polls, Twitter insider program
         - Famoso Pizza uses social media research, know pros and cons
       - (textbook) projective technique: subjects are provided with a scenario and asked to express their thoughts and feelings about it
     - Quantitative research techniques 
       - **experiments**
       - **survey**
         - widely used to study consumers' attitudes, preferences, behaviours, and knowledge about products and brands
         - generally more cost-effective
         - questionnaires -> quantitative data -> analyzed by sophisticated statistical methods
         - short comings: unable to answer/forget/interpret differently
         - questionaire: unstructured questions (open-ended, answer in own words) vs structured questions (close-ended, e.g. multiple choice)
       - **scanner** 
       - **panel** 

   - The “best” research design 
     - There are never a single, standard, correct method of carrying out a piece if research….
     - There are many ways to tackle a problem…
     - A research method for a given problem is not like the solution to a problem in algebra 
     - It is more like a recipe for beef stroganoff; there is no one best recipe.
   - Conclusive research methods
     - descriptive
     - experimental - systematic manipulation 

4. **Analyzing data and develop insights**

   - converting *data* into *information* to expalin, predict and/or evaluate a particular situation

5. **Present action plans**
   - executive summary 
   - Body 
   - Conclusion 
   - Limitations
   - Supplements 
     - tables 
     - figure 
     - appendixes

# Week 5

### Midterm

- study completely
- read all the questions
- plan your time
- *3 column method* (Theory - Description - Apply)
- list, describe and apply
  - answer the 5 w's when applying (Who - what - when - where - why) make the answer "colourful"
  - directly connect company when applying

### Post Sink

> A new men's clothing store is trying to determine if there is a significant market for its type of mechandise in a specific location where it is considering putting a store. Would it be most likely to use primary or secondary data, or a combination of the two, to answer this question and what examples would you suggest?

- always start with secondary data (demographic, competitors)
- also need primary research
- determine what I need to know -> what research method

Post sink answer

- The clothing store should use a combination of both primary and secondary data to answer the question
  - It could use secondary research, such as Census results, the number of clothing stores in the area, and the amount of traffic that passes the location every day, to determine market size, competition, and exposure to passers by. 
  - It probably needs primary research to find more up-to-date or unavailable information, such as fashion trends for the targeted demographic and whether men in the area would be willing to buy new clothes. I would use a survey method one-on-one and potentially stand on a street corner in the area and intercept people or work with the postal office to drop off surveys to all the houses in the area (mailed out survey). 

### Measuring Success of Strategic Decisions

Introduction MY income statements (7 elements)

- gross sales
  - are the entire dollar amount if the item was sold at full value (list price or full retail price) for the goods sold during a given period
  - total sales figure
- customer returns and allowances (CR&A)
  - return - merchandise returned to stock for a refund/credit
    - quality control issue if there are a lot of return
    - thus a need to generate a report for returns
  - allowance - a price reduction at time of sale
    - question: why are we offering so many discounts
- net sales
  - gross sales - CR&A = net sales
- cost of goods sold
- gross margin
  - net sales - COGS = gross margin
- operating expenses
  - variable & fixed expenses
  - variable: varies directly with sales of unites
  - fixed: whether you sell 1 unit or 100 it is the same (e.g. salary, advertising, etc.)
- NIBITDA (net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) or EBITDA (earnings before ...)
  - gross margin - operating expenses = NIBITDA

|               | dollars | % of net sales* |
| ------------- | ------- | --------------- |
| Gross sales   |         |                 |
| CR&A          |         |                 |
| Net sales     |         |                 |
| COGS          |         |                 |
| Gross margin  |         |                 |
| Opearting exp |         |                 |
| NIBITDA       |         |                 |

*: for bonus!

### Business Metrics Discussion

- why is this information important?
  - gives you insight in your business
  - gives you a story (at one point in time)
  - it is not cash flow
  - look at ways to grow your top line/bottom line

|               | dollars | % of net sales |
| ------------- | ------- | -------------- |
| Gross sales   | 9435    | n/a            |
| CR&A          | 1200    | n/a            |
| Net sales     | 8235    | 100.00%        |
| COGS          | 4505    | 54.71%         |
| Gross margin  | 3730    | 45.29%         |
| Opearting exp | 800     | 9.71%          |
| NIBITDA       | 2930    | 35.58%         |

A key point to remember: this class is all about the SHIFT

- **shift** over time ...
  - who we are
  - our financial stability
  - competitors
  - demographics
  - social norms ... etc
- look at shifts as opportunities that marketers can take advantage of

## Chapter 3

### Marketing environments

the factors and forces outside marketing's direct control that affect marketing management's ability to develop and maintain successful transactions with its target customers

- outside the control of a marketer
- impacts the ability of marketers to connect
- "work in" vs "work on" your business

#### Micro environment

- **the company**
  - a marketer or marketing department must collaborate with others to achive results
  - think of a marketer as a general manager of a business unit. Therefore she/he must work with
    - other departments in the firm (internal environment)
    - suppliers
    - marketing intermediaries
    - customers
- **immediate environment: corporate partners/suppliers**
  - suppliers can provide more than just resources
  - need to work with suppliers to *drive costs out* of the system but also *improve quality*
    - part of "value delivery system"
  - supplier and market pricing trends impact the company
    - margin improvement teams (include suppliers)
      - if you can save "a penny" on every item you make, the benefit can be enormous (depending on what you make)
      - be careful of the "sausage rule"
- **competition**
  - competitors - why do I care?
  - competitor myopia? Pepsi is not CocaCola's only competitor
  - bull's eye diagram revisited
  - competitive intelligence (**CI**): collect and sythesize information about firm's position with respect to their rivals
  - how does understanding your competition help you build a successful business?
  - how should you access and collect data on your competition
  - how should you react to a new competitive threat?
    - should you attack?
    - should you retreat and protect what you have and hope they leave you alone?
    - something else?
  - unique competitive effort

#### Macroenvironment - "shift in"

there is nothing you can do to change it, need to react

- **demographic**

  - size, density, location, age, sex, race, occupation, income, other statistics

  - **income**

    - upper-class: affluent, not affected by economic conditions, 48% Canadian households
    - middle-class: careful about spending, 38% Canadian households
    - working-class/low-income: barely sufficient income to cover basic needs, 14.2% Canadian households

  - changing Canadian trends:

    - age shift
    - income shift
    - increased life expectancy
    - increasing non-family households
    - marrying later
    - having fewer children
    - shift in couples roles

  - 5 distinct generations or **generation cohorts**(can have 5 generations at the workplace)

    | Name                        | Born        | Business/Career Goal    |

    | Generation Z                | 1995-2009   | Build Social "Network"  |

- **economic**

  - foreign currency fluctuations
  - combined with **inflation** and **interest rates** affect firms' ability to market goods and services
  - the world wide economy was shocked - businesses prepare for a **recession**
  - the Bank of Canada continues to raise its prime rate after years of decline. What effect does thi rate have on the Canadian economy?
    - value of the dollar
      - exporters & importers
      - tourism
    - value of debt to consumers/businesses
      - decreased borrowing
      - impact in future of shifting rates based on debt level - lower disposable income, reduced spending

- **social/natural**

  - green
    - growing shortage of raw materials
      - water, fuel
    - increase pollution and the cost to clean it up
    - increased government intervention deu to lack of self regulation
      - environmental protection act (1989)
    - environmentally sustainable strategies - can they be profitable?
    - no "greenwashing"
  - privacy
    - Googling someone
    - e.g. Ashley Madison
  - (textbook) the time-poor society
    - multitasking: cannot focus on ads
    - change ways of advertising: traditional venues -> internet based, etc.
    - extended store hours, self-checkout lanes
  - healthy lifestyle
    - 24/7 is required to survive today
    - opened up new markets and niches focused on healthy living
    - e.g. yoga classes, mats, and clothing

- **technological**

  - changing delivery methods shifting how business is done
  - new smartphone technology is allowing more engagement
  - the high cost of research and development and the high cost of not doing it
    - the new liberal government indicated it would invest in tax credits to spur on research

- **political/legal**

  - raised minimum wage (to 14 then to 15)
    - significant impact
    - without raising to 15: can hire more people
    - raising to 15: prices will raise, more automation, McDonald's increase of Kiosks
  - spring political shift
  - Canadian employment numbers:
    - Canada lost 88000 jobs
    - Largest decline in Ontario: 59000 part-time jobs lost

- **cultural**

  - country culture vs regional subculture
  - consider the marketing implications
    - name and language on material
    - e.g. coke vs pop vs soda
  - what cultural shifts have you seen over the past 20 years?

- vendor performance assessment
  - business analyze their vendor's performance, allowing them to make better decisions about future purchases

### B2B marketing

- Business-to-business marketing
- key distinction between B2B and B2C: who is the end user?
- Classic example - Dole situation

  - Differences between B2B and B2C markets?
  - What factors might affect the B2B process? 
- key challenges of reaching B2B clients (textbook)
  - must identify the right persons or decision makers within the organizations who can authorize or influence purchases

1. need recognition
2. product specification
3. RFP (request for proposal) process
4. proposal analysis and supplier selection
5. order specification
6. vendor/performance assessment

#### Who you are actually selling to

- **resellers** (e.g. Amazon, Zehrs): resell without significantly altering their form
- **governments** (the largest, why most companies want to get the business contract): infrastructure, highways, etc.
- **manufacturers**: buy raw good, add to it; also buys uniforms, Mr.Clean, equipment to produce
- **institutions**: e.g. hospitals, educational organizations, etc. may buy goods and services for people they serve, such as printers

#### Differences between B2B and B2C markets

|                | B2B characteristics                                          | B2B example                                                  | B2C example                                                  |

## Chapter 8 Product development

Individual product decisions

It all fits together to give a total experience

Buidling your product puzzle:

- packaging
- labeling
- product attributes
- branding

Why do firms create new products?

- changing customer needs
- market saturation
- managing risk through diversity
- fashion cycles
  - video games, apparel
- improving business relationships

### Adoption of innovation 

- diffusion of innovation: innovation gets adopted over time by different groups
- pioneers: really good new product introductions
- disruptive innovations: new product introductions that are simpler, less sophisticated, and usually less expensive than existing products or services (jiang wei da ji)
- first movers: first to create the market or product category
- **consumer adoption cycle**
  - innovators
  - early adopters
  - early majority
  - late majority
  - laggards   
- understand what the diffusion curve for the new product is, target customers in each stage of the diffusion
- **factors affecting product diffusion speed**
  -  relative advantage
    - better than substitutes
  - compatibility
    - compatible with culture
    - e.g. smaller vacuum in Asian countries v.s. bigger in north america
  - observability
    - make products easily observed
    - e.g. viral YouTube video
  - complexity and trialability
    - less complex, easy to use -> diffuse more quickly

### Product attributes

- quality
  - the ability of a product to perform its functions including overall durability, reliability, precision, ease of correction/repair and other valued attributes
  - two dimentions:
    - level
    - consistency:
  - fundamental difference: McDonald's burger vs the works burger
    - McDonald's: most consistent burger
    - work's: high level of quality
- feature and style/design
  - feature
    - Features are a tool for differentiation 
    - Value of features versus cost to company 
  - style/design
    - Style based solely on visual impact 
    - Does not make product perform better 
    - Design contributes to usefulness (more than skin deep) 
  - Two together = attention, improved performance, cut costs, competitive advantage 
  - form follows function!
    - form of the product follows the function it needs to perform
    - need to deliver from a functional perspective
  - people are willing to pay for products that functions the way that they are supposed to

### New Product Development

- Overview
  - 50% of all products sold today were not around 5 years ago
  - you have no choice but to innovate
  - make sure that consumers see the value
- shifty consumers
- new product development strategy
  - two sources:
    - aquisition: company, patent, license
    - new product development internally * discussed here
  - e.g. shampoo purchase vs creation
- success factors:
  - **unique superior product** (me too does not work)
  - unique superior product
  - well defined product concept from startup
  - specific criteria
  - specific startegic role
  - systematice new-product process
  - creative staff
- why do new products fail?
  - too small target market
  - poor design
  - low product quality
  - incorrect positioning
    - e.g. ReeseSticks, peanut butter puffs
    - need to be consistent
  - wrong price strategy
  - poor marketing communication
  - competition

### How firms develop new products

1. **idea generation**

   > development of viable new product ideas

   - it's a team effort
     - internal resources
       - employees, sales people, R&D, managers
       - intrapreneurial programs
     - customers
     - competitors
     - distributors and suppliers
     - entrepreneurs
   - sources of ideas (multiple choice?)
     - **internal R&D**
       - high cost
       - end result can be technological or market breakthrough
       - continuous investment
       - reverse innovation (not to be confused with reverse engineering):  turn to less developed markets for new product ideas
     - **licensing**
       - buy the rights to use the technology or ideas from other research intensive firms through a licensing agreement
       - saves high costs of internal R&D
       - banking on a solution that already exists but has not been marketed
     - **brainstorming**
       - brainstorming sessions during which a group works together to generate ideas
       - no idea can be immediately accepted or rejected, need to vote
     - **outsourcing**
       - some firms offer stellar service that helps generate new product and service ideas
     - **competitor's products**
       - reverse engineering: taking apart a competitor's product, analyzing it, creating an improved product that does not infringe on the competitor's patents
     - **customer input**
       - listening to the customer
       - 85% of B2B
       - B2C: variety of sources
       - social media: monitor online feedback, customer reviews
       - observe how products are used
       - analyze lead users: innovative product users who modify existing products according to their own ideas to suit their specific needs
   - systematic process
     - appoint a new business development officer of idea manager
     - all areas of company should be representde - multidisciplinary commitee
     - contact methods formalized so all know
     - encourage staff to submit ideas
     - make praise visible - formal recognition
   - yields
     - innovation culture
     - more ideas
   - personally - hire people that do not fit
   - validation of idea
     - purpose
       - identify good ideas drop poor ones fast - help create clarity of focus
     - challenge
       - maintain creativity and stream of ideas
     - link criteria and rating to company objectives
       - will the customer buy it
       - dos it fit with the company mission and objectives
   - preliminary plan
     - market segmentation
     - target market segmentation

   - customers reactions determine whether or not it goes forward
   - triggers the marketing research process
   - process
     - qualitative first: in-depth interviews or focus groups
     - quantitative next: internet or mall-intercept surveys
     - target consumers exposed to new-product concepts
     - word or picture description
     - physical presentation of the concept
     - question reactions

3. product development

   >  development of prototypes and/or the product

   1. prototype: first physical form or service description of a new product, still in rough or tentative form
   2. alpha testing: in the firm's R&D department
   3. beta testing: examine the product prototype in a "real use" setting, like developing multiple prototypes and survey users on which one they liked

4. market testing

   > testing the actual products in a few test markets

   - premarket tests
     - customers exposed
     - customers surveyed
     - firm makes decision

   - test marketing
     - mini product launch
     - more expensive then premarket tests, also takes longer
     - market demand is estimated
     - pros
       - reduce uncertainty about product and marketing approach
       - saves risk and expense of full launch
       - gain experience
     - cons
       - high cost
       - longer time-to-market
       - tip your launch to competitors
   - standard test markets
     - London Ontario 2017 Test Market - isolation

5. product launch

   > full-scale commercialization of the product

   - satisfaction of financial requirements
   - satisfaction of technical requirements
   - customer acceptance
   - promotion
     - develop appropriate IMC strategy

6. evaluation of result

  - introduction stage
    - innovators trying new offering
    - initial losses because of high start-up costs and low levels of sales revenue

    - goal: ride the rising sales trend and establish brand, prevent outdone by competitors
  - maturity stage
    - intense competition for market share among firms
    - increase marketing costs
    - saturated market

## Chapter 18 Ethics

### Creative introduction - ethics vs. social responsibility

- ethics
  - set of values that guide decision making
  - only works if all employees in the company align with these values
- social responsibility
  - voluntary actions taken by a company to contribute to improving society as a whole
  - stakeholders
    - employees
      - job enrichment
      - compensation and benefits
      - opinions matter
    - consumers
      - effective campaigns
    - marketplace
      - animal testing
- a company can be one, but not necessarily the other
- nike example: socially responsible but not ethical

### What is ethics

- e.g. tell us a time where you had to choose what was right and what was easy

- Menu Foods
  - wet pet food
  - caused pets to have crystals within kidneys
  - did not recall products in time
  - largest consumer product recall ever in N.A.
  - stock price plummeted 52%
  - company went bankrupt and was purchased by several of the companies that used them to make their foods

- Tylenol
  - most successful over-the-counter product in the US with over one hundred million users
  - Johnson&Johnson
  - Cyanide poisoning
  - reaction: product immediately removed from shelves
  - **a**cknowledged, **a**pologized, **a**ssured (great way to make sure that you've actually protected yourselves)
  - assure: find a way to prevent the products from being contaminated - glue the packaging, seal the bottle
  - shareholders and consumers liked what the saw

- six tests of ethical action
  1. the publicity test: Would I want to see this action that I'm about to take described on the front page of the local paper or in a national magazine?
  2. the moral mentor test: Would the person I admire the most engage in this activity
  3. the admired observer test: Would I want the person I admire most to see me doing this?** ask about this
  4. the transparency test: Could I give a clear explanation for the action I'm contemplating, including an honest and transparent account of all my motives, that would satisfy a fair and dispassionate moral judge?
  5. the person in the mirror test: Will I be able to look at myself in the mirror and respect the person I see there?
  6. the golden rule test: Would I like to be on the receiving end of this action and all its potential consequences?

- a framework for ethical decision making

  1. identify issues
  2. gather information and identify stakeholders
  3. brainstorm and evaluate alternatives
  4. choose a course of action

- integrating ethics into marketing strategy

  1. planning phase

     - decide what level of commitment to its ethical policies and standards it is willing to declare publicly

     - including ethical statements in the firm's mission statement

  2. implementing phase

     - "Can we serve the market with the firm's products or services in an ethically responsible manner?"

     - when firms are identifying potential markets and ways to deliver the 4Ps to them

  3. Control phase

     - ensure that all potential ethical issues raised during the planning process have been addressed and that all employees of the firm have acted ethically

     - managers must be evaluated on their actions from an ethical perspective

# Week 7

Exam Style Question (example)

- need to be specific to the question/scenario

  | List          | Definition                                                   | Application              |
  | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------ |
  | Geographic    | Where do they live?                                          | e.g. people living in ON |
  | Demographic   | Who are they?                                                | ..                       |
  | Psychographic | How do they live?<br />What is their lifestyle?              | ..                       |
  | Behavioural   | Why do they buy?<br />How often?<br />How do they plan to use the products/services? | ..                       |

- post sink
  - admired observer test
  - idea validation
  - which stage has the highest number of competitors? maturity.

## Chapter 10 Services

Ok I did not find any lecture notes for this chapter or lecture slides related to this chapter :weary: below are all from the text :book:

Unique characteristics affecting service:

- **I**ntangible
  - cannot be touched, tasted, or seen like a pure product can
  - cannot be shown directly, need symbols and images to promote and sell
  - e.g. Walt Disney World
- **I**nseparable from their providers
  - service and consumption are inseparable
  - cannot be "returned" - services sometimes provide extended warranties and 100 percent satisfaction guarantees
- **I**nconsistent (variable)
  - because humans
  - **training and standardization**: reduce service inconsistency
  - used to an advantage: micromarketing strategy (e.g. Planet Fitness)
  - **replace people with machines**: reduce inconsistency (e.g. ATM)
  - internet-enabled kiosks
- cannot be held in **I**nventory
  - perishable
  - challenges and opportunities in terms of the critical task of matching demand and supply - balancing the ups and downs of demand and capacity

### The GAPS model

| GAP                   | What it is                                                   | To close/narrow                                              |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| The knowledge gap     | the difference between customers' expectations and the firm's perception of those customer expectations | match customer expectations with actual service through research |
| The standards gap     | the difference between the firm's perceptions of customers' expectations and the service standards it sets | set appropriate service standards and measure service performance |
| The delivery gap      | the difference between the firm's service standards and the actual service it provides to customers | get employees to meet or exceed service standards            |
| The communication gap | the difference between the actual service provided to customers and the service that the firm's promotion program promises | be more realistic about the services they can provide and manage customer expectations effectively |

- building blocks of service quality
  - reliability: the ability to perform the service dependably and accurately
  - responsiveness: the willingness to help customers and provide prompt service
  - assurance: the knowledge of and courtesy by employees and their ability to convey trust and confidence
  - empath: the caring, individualized attention provided to customers
  - tangibles: the appearance of physical facilities, equipment, personnel, and communication materials
- voice-of-customer (VOC) program: collects customer insights and intelligence to influence and drive business decisions
- zone of tolerance: the area between customers' expectations regarding their desired service and the minimum level of acceptable service - the difference between what the customer really wants and what he or she will accept before going elsewhere
- effective service recovery
  1. listening to the customer
  2. providing a fair solution
  3. resolving the problem quickly

# Week 8 - Chapter 11

- Price's role in the marketing mix
  - Price is usually ranked as one of the most important factors in purchase decisions ... but is it?
    - price is only part of the puzzle
    - it is not the most important piece of puzzle
  - **price is the only marketing mix element that generates revenue**
- You need to get price right!
  - will impact product development
  - will impact customers
  - will impact profits
- Don't get fooled
  - vendor of raw materials -> manufacturer -> wholesaler -> retailer
  - previous person's price is the second person's cost
- Break-even analysis
- Financial questions 
- Definition of price
  - amount of money charged for a product or service
  - the <u>sum of values</u> consumers exchange for the benefits of having or using the product or service
- Taco Bell value pricing
  - pricing is a challenge, not your sole competitive advantage
  - make consumers think that they are not compromising
- Price is a signal
  - prices can be both too high and too low
  - price too low may signal poor quality
  - price set too high might signal low value
- Every 1% matters
- Constantly deliver more value
- Know your competition

## 5 C's of pricing

### Company objectives

- profit orientation
  - **target return pricing**: profit goal
  - **maximizing profits**: economic theory
  - **target profit pricing** : require a certain rate
- sales orientation
  - price to drive sales
  - focus on increasing sales
  - more concerend with overall market share
  - does not always imply setting low prices
    - leading brands
    - value relation
- competitor orientation
  - at $9.99 no one thinks about it, when would you think about it?
  - price parity
  - set $ relatively higher or lower to signal a value position relative to competitors
- customer orientation
  - focus on customer expectations by matching prices to customer expectations

### Customers demand curve

- demand curves and pricing
- price elasticity of demand
  - inelastic: increase price and not lose a lot of customers
  - elastic: e.g. gas station
- not all are downward sloping (e.g. luxury watches)
- prestige product or services have upward sloping curves

- factors influencing price elasticity of demand
  - cross-price elasticity: refills: buying new games for a game consol; you can get printer for cheaper than the toner
  - substitution effect: watching Netflix at home VS going to a cinema
  - income effect

### Costs

- variable costs
  - vary with production volume
- fixed costs
  - unaffected by production volume
- total costs
  - sum of variable and fixed costs

### Competition

- monopolistic
  - not monopoly, standard
- pure
  - commodities
  - all priced the same, no branding
- oligopoly
  - large industries with very few players, all shift together
  - e.g. airlines, telecommunications
- monopoly
  - beer stores

### Channel members

- manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers can have different perspectives on pricing strategies
- manufactures must protect against gray market transactions

## General pricing strategies

- cost-based methods
  - mark-up (denominator is always the retail price)
  - cost-based pricing methods start with cost
  - all costs calculated on a per unit basis
  - assumes costs don't vary for different levels of production
- competitor-based methods
  - set prices to signal information of how product compares with competitors
  - premium pricing
- value-based methods
  - setting prices that focus on the overall value of the product
  - consumer perceptions
  - e.g. ice-climbing jackets
  - customers tell you what's important
  - should a firm raise prices if it determines that the cutsomer values the item more than the current price?
  - **improvement value method**
    - In the improvement value method, the manager must estimate the improvement value of a new product or service. This improvement value represents an estimate of how much more, or
      less, consumers are willing to pay for a product relative to other comparable
      products.
  - **cost of ownership**
    - the cost of total ownership is considered not just the purchase price
    - Honda Civic

## Pricing strategies

- **Everyday low pricing**
  - consistent price somewhere between competitors' regular prices and discount prices

- **High/low pricing**
  - large difference between regular prices and discounted prices

- **New product pricing**
  - **Price skimming**
    - take a higher price in the initial stages, to recover the cost of R&D
    - people see value in being the first ones to buy
    - e.g. technology (iPhone more expensive when it just launched, decreases in price a year later), drugs
    - gives you the opportunity to reinvest

  - **Market penetration pricing**
    - Low initial price, I want volume
    - what Netflix did in NA

## Pricing tactics

- strategies: must balance all 5Cs
- tactics: tend to focus on select components
- **price lining**
  - marketers establish a price floor and a price ceiling and set prices in between
  - allows for easy comparison
- **price bundling**
  - encourage sales of slow moving items
  - encourage stock up
  - encourage trial of new brand
  - incentive to purchase
- **leader pricing/loss leaders**
  - enticing consumers into the store with the popular aggressively priced item and hoping they will pick up other items while shopping
- **B2B pricing tactics and discount**
  - seasonal discounts
  - cash discounts
  - allowances
  - quantity discounts
  - uniform delivered versus geographic pricing
- **consumer price reductions**
  - markdowns
  - quantity discounts for consumers
  - seasonal discounts
  - coupons and rebates

# Week 9

Final project insights

- how to construct (exhibits first)
- apply text/nots (not definitions)
  - pricing (new from text)
- sources ... euromonitor/GMID
- would you invest?
  - if you read this and you don't want to invest in it -> bad idea
  - need enough information in the report to make the decision
  - if the conclusion is "i have no idea" -> not enough depth
- page limit: stop marking after the page limit, so do not go over the page limit
- layout
  - break down into bite sized chunks
  - table of contents

## Chapter 12 Distribution and its impact

- Distribution/place
  - **where will you get access to the right market**
  - **where do they "work, live & play"**
  - alibaba - 30 billion dollars on one day
  - do your customers go to hockey games - sponsor like Scotiabank arena: having that name somewhere on a ticket or a screen could be worth it

- Consumer & industrial marketing channels
  - standard flow of product and services
  - difference: how you move your products
  - productivity of distribution ... true anymore?
    - chart: explains why intermediaries are important
    - **without intermediary**: 16 interactions
    - **with intermediary**: 8 interactions, and the intermediary takes a cut (e.g. Sears)
      - now, we may buy directly from the manufactuer, but usually we buy online (still an intermediary)
      - if we buy directly from Panasonic, or if we buy online / instores from BestBuy, **should be the same price**. for the manufacturer, it is more efficient to sell through an intermediary
      - there's the belief that we are moving back (to without intermediary), but we are actually moving to a hybrid

- push and pull promotional strategy
  - **push**
    - manufacturer goes directly to the retailer, persuade them to buy 
    - product is **pushed out** to the consumer
    - traditionally smaller brands
      - brands that cant afford / don't have the resources to get the 70% distribution
      - e.g. limit the distribution in Ontario, 10 stores, you will go talk to retailers individually and educate them on your product, so when customers come in, the retailer will recommend your product to them.
  - **pull**
    - manufacturer advertises to the consumer, then consumers go into stores and look for something
    - real life: retailers sell what they have
    - need to have 70% distribution
    - traditionally larger brands
      - President's choice: advertising Christmas goods
      - Loblaw's cooking class - $25 and you learn how to cook and get a meal!
    - from a brand's perspective, if you have the money -> use this strategy

- listing fees

  - the fee you pay a retailer for them to carry your product in stores
  - **important: for the project, consider the listing fee, talk about it**
  - e.g. purpose to Sobeys your new organic drink
    - if you want to get distribution in all of Loblaw's (Loblaw's, NoFrills, Zehrs, etc.), one SKU will take a million dollars or more -> super expensive to get distribution
    - the retailer needs to do redo the layout/plan (fee to)
    - cover the potential loss of carrying a product that does not deliver
    - physicl limit: kill the brand or delist, despite you payed the millions of dollars
  - fees range from
    - a few hundred dollars
    - to $25,000 per item per store
    - to $1 million per grocery chain

  - covers costs of inventory management in systems, accommodating new products in warehouse and aligning store shelves to fit the new product
    - gets you on shelves, gets you on the planogram, guarantees you at least 6 months
    - however, you do not get to choose where you are on shelves: only the top brands get the best spot on the planogram
    - the reason why Colgate has so much shelf space is retailers do not want to keep restocking the shelves: need enough products constantly sitting on the shelves
  - why? retailers do not want manufacturers to constantly come out with new products to add to stores, this is not efficient. retailers need manufacturers to always give them the best products that will sell well
  - store within a store is different - promotional fee & a fee to have store lay it out as such
  - innovative products may not have listing fees
    - if innovative, backed by promotional program and will increase category sales ... no fee
    - e.g. whitestrips
    - another advantage of being unique in the market place

### Channel management

#### Selecting retail partners

What makes the best?

- channel structure/power
- customer expectations
- characteristics
  - years in business
  - other lines carried
  - growth and profit record
  - cooperation and reputation
  - sales force size and quality
  - retail custoemrs, location, and growth potential
  - alignment is key: selling high end kitchen products, probably not at Walmart

#### Distribution intensity ... customer expectations?

- **intensive**
  - e.g. Timex
- **selective**
  - e.g. M Kors
- **exclusive**
  - e.g. Rolex
  - the brand has power that brings people into retail

#### Marketing systems: vertical and horizontal

- conventional
  - manufactuer -> wholesaler -> retailer -> consumer
- vertical
  - manfacturer, wholsaler, retailer -> consumer
  - power play:
    - **administered systems** (example: P&G)
      - power exercised by a single member
      - often the leading brand owner
      - alternatively the best marketing strategy
      - control resides at any level
      - large retailers often control through buying power
      - so strong that they can control the entire channel
      - P&G vs Loblaw's
        - delisting Tide
        - consumers stop going to Loblaw's because they don't want to go to two stores
        - Tide is back in 48 hours
        - shows the power of Tide
    - **contractual systems**
      - control exercised through legal contracts
      - e.g. franchises, wholesaler-sponsored chains, retailer co-operatives
    - **corporate systems**
      - all levels of production and distribution controlled by one firm
      - control is corporate organizational rule
      - primary business of the system can reside at any level of the system
      - one company owns everything in the channel
- functions performed by intermediaries
  - **transactional**
    - buying
    - selling
    - risk taking
    - promotion
  - **logistical function**
    - physical distribution
    - storing
  - **facilitating function**
    - gather information
    - financing
- changing channel organization
  - disintermediation
    - bypassing and going direct
    - radical new channels
    - traditional intermediaries dropping by wayside
      - need to add value
    - causes channel conflict
- RFID technology
  - will become the new way that we shop
  - will replace barcodes
  - automatically charge your card for items you take with you - no need for a checkout line
- logistics management (LO 4)
  - **universal product code (UPC)**: the black and white bar code found on most merchandise
  - **electronic data interchange (EDI)**: computer-to-computer exchange of business documents from a retailer to a vendor and back
  - **advanced shipping notice**: an electronic document that the supplier sends the retailer in advance of a shipment to tell the retailer exactly what to expect in the shipment
  - **vendor-managed inventory (VMI)**: an approach for improving marketing channel efficiency in which the manufacturer is responsible for maintaining the retailer's inventory levels in each of its stores
  - distribution centres vs direct store delivery
  - distribution (fulfillment) centre
    - inbound transportation
      - dispatcher: the person who coordinates deliveries
    - receiving and checking using UPC or RFID
    - RFID: radio frequency identification tags, eliminates the need to handle items individually
    - storing and cross-docking 
    - ticketing and marking: creating price and identification labels and placing them on the merchandise
  - inventory management through just-in-time systems 
    - JIT (also quick response, QR)
    - reduces **lead time** (time between recognition that an order needs to be placed and the arrival of the needed merchandise at the seller's store, ready for sale)

- for project: use at least three tools from this chapter, what is the appeal?

start of textbook notes:point_down:

- Communication
  - sender
  - transmitter
  - encoding: idea -> message
  - communication channel: the medium
  - receiver
  - noise: interference
  - feedback loop: receiver -> sender

### Steps in IMC (integrated marketing communications) compaign

1. identify target audience

   - research to determine media
   - may not be current users
   - using technology

2. set objectives

   - inform, persuade, remind
     - inform
       - use this in project!
       - telling the market about a new product
       - suggesting new uses for a product
       - describing available services
     - persuade
       - building brand preference
       - encouraging switching to your brand
       - changing buyer perceptions of product
     - remind
       - used by top-of-mind companies
       - maintaining top-of-mind product awareness
       - reminding of the consumer need in case it arises in the future
   - communication objectives - e.g. stimulate demand or increase awareness?
   - tying objectives to execution
   - push or pull

3. determine budget

   | method                   | definition                                                   | limitations                                                  |
   | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
   | **Objective and task**   | based on the cost of specific tasks required to achieve communication objectives | difficult to identify tasks that will achieve objectives -> most difficult method |
   | **Competitive parity**   | share of communication expenses in line with market share    | prevents exploiting unique opportunities, same market share over time |
   | **Percentage of sales**  | based on a fixed percentage of forecasted sales<br />simple, easy to use | assumes appropriate percentage, doesn't consider new plans<br />when your business starts to down turn, this does not work |
   | **Affordable budgeting** | based on what is left over after other operating costs have been covered<br />set at level management thinks company can afford<br />most companies | assumes communication expenses do not stimulate sales and profit<br />have the possibility to spend too much or too less, both of which is ineffective |

4. convey message

   - the message
     - **unique selling proposition**: slogan in an advertising campaign
     - unique, meaningful, sustainable
   - the appeal
     - **rational appeal**

       - e.g. Kleenex Anti-Viral Tissues
     - **emotional appeal**
       - satisfy customers' emotional desires rather than utilitarian needs
       - use emotion to create a bond
       - e.g. Coca-Cola's polar bear, Telus using nature

5. evaluate and select media

   - media planning
   - media mix: combination of media used and the frequence of advertising in each medium
   - media buy: the purchase of airtime or print pages
   - **mass and niche media**
     - **mass media:** national newspapers, magazines, radio, and television
     - **niche media:** more focused to reach narrower segments, e.g. specialty magazines
   - choosing the right medium
     - different media for different purposes
     - cost
   - determining the advertising schedule
     - **continuous advertising schedule:** runs steadily throughout the year
     - **flighting advertising schedule:** implemented in spurts
     - **pulsing advertising schedule:** combines continuous and flighting schedules
   - every media campaign must have same form of evaluation as part of the budget
     - copy testing (pre testing)
     - communication effects of on air work (tracking)
     - sales effects (Post)
       - good sales not necessarily caused by the ad

|           | explanation                                                  | give me an example                                         |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| attention | here we need to grab their attention, stop them in their track and have them notice us | out-of-homes                                               |
| interest  | physically doing somethin, engaging and anchoring in consumers' brains | multiple forms of media, repetitive                        |
| desire    | give consumers **more** information to help them make the decision | website/direct marketing (not out-of-home like billboards) |
| action    | consumers able to ask question and get answers, last few tips to get them to make the purchase | "do I get warranty on this?"                               |

- attention/awareness
  - you have to get their attention
- interest
  - differentiating proposition is the key
- desire
  - move them from "I like it" to "I want it"
- action

- evangelism
  - becoming raving fans

> attention leads to interest, which leads to desire, which leads to action
