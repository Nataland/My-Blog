### Positioning
- the centre 
- why Jack Astors is not the same as Boston Pizza
- key: relative to competitors

### Develop Consumer Value
- Operational excellence
    - faster, more efficient
    - e.g. Walmart (bought a satellite)
- Product excellence
    - “me too” is not going to take you very far
    - need to create something unique
    - you can charge more, and people will be willing to pay for it
    - e.g. Lexus: great product quality
- Locational excellence
	- makes a huge difference because there are many options & online retailing
	- McDonald's, Tim Hortons
- Customer excellence
    - why you keep returning to your favourite restaurant
    - e.g. Costco, Nordstrom

Marketing is not about what's happened, it's about what you predict

- Market penetration
  - existing target market, same product: get more people to buy more, or attract new customers within the same target market
  - take your existing products and bundle them to get someone to buy more
  - e.g. Tim Horton's Roll up the Rim
- Product development
  - existing target market, new product
  - develop a new product like Apple Watch
  - e.g. Tim Horton's add latte to their product line
- Market development
  - new target market, same product
  - develop a new market like the senior market
  - e.g. People can get a meal at Tim Horton's
- Diversification
  - new target market, new product
  - completely new product
  - e.g. Tim Horton's gluten free menu

Next week: target marketing: which consumers in the market are the right ones to go to
You cannot traget everybody. 
e.g. to target the senior market, add benches to supermarkets
Understand your target market, change your products according to your market
Read the positioning document and come prepped for the quiz



# Class 3

### Post Sink: Companywide Strategic Planning

- Setting Company Objectives and Goals
- The goal of your company is to become the number one brand for Smart Phones (SOM & Sales) by Dec 31,2021
- currently #4 behind Samsung and Apple

Marketing Objectives:

- Who are my competitors?
- Perceptual Map
- Strategy: penetration, product development, market development, diversification
- location(place)

### Target Consumers (STP - Segmenting-targeting-positioning)

- The most critical business concept, 100% on the midterm & final

- Once you know your target market, the only other mantra is **execution**

- Gives you a direction: who are my customers? (identifying customers) how do I talk to them?

- Market segmentation (step 2)

  - **Geographic**
    - Where customers live
    - Where you should open you stores, etc. Important!!
    - *North America, Asia, Europe, Africa*
    - *Atlantic, Central, Western Canada*
  - **Demographic**
    - Age, education, income, etc.
    - Most commonly used, easy to do
    - One of the worst ways you can segment the market: purchase behaviour is different from demographic
    - *Age, gender, income, occupation, ethnic, background, religion, etc.*
  - **Psychographic**
    - The best one, toughist, challenging to understand
    - The way people think typically translates into how they buy
    - Explains: why do you do what you do?
    - *Lifestyles, values*
    - *Innovators, thinkers, achievers, etc.* 
  - **Behavioural**
    - The way people act
    - How loyal are they to a brand, are they a heavy user of a brand, what they normally do
    - e.g. convenience oriented customers
    - *Benefits Sought, Loyalty or Usage Patterns*
    - *Convenience, economy, prestige,*
    - *Completely loyal, not loyal, somewhat loyal*

- Market targeting

- Market positioning

- 5 steps (steps leading up to developing the correct positioning/STP):

  1. **Strategy or objectives** (always start with objectives: what are we trying to achieve) - Segmentation
  2. **Segmentation base** - Segmentation
  3. **Evaluate segment attractiveness** - Targeting
  4. **Select target market** - Targeting
  5. **Identify and develop positioning strategy** - Positioning

- Another way (from top to bottom: segmentation -> targeting -> positioning)

  1. take market and divide up into homogeneous segments
     - online shopping example: homogeneous groups of different sizes
     - e.g. younger people & seniors
  2. describe/profile each resulting segment
     - Dove advertisement example: people who had pressure to look a certain way
     - Budweiser advertisement example: target market is women, puppies, horses, good-looking men, but did not connect
  3. evaluate and then rank each segments attractiveness
  4. select the most appropriate target segments
  5. develop positioning for each target segment
  6. develop marketing mix for each target segment

- Describing a tarket market:

  - BMW: for performance
  - Volvo: safety, parents
  - Sunlife commercial: targeting people who dont like their jobs

- Give your target market a name (will lose marks if you don't)

  - e.g. hard-working moms


# Class 4

- Selecting market segments
  - **undifferentiated marketing**
    - nobody uses this now
  - **differentiated marketing**
    - most mass companies
    - a few segments
  - **concentrated marketing**
    - smaller companies
    - one segment
  - **customized marketing**
    - 1-to-1 marketing
    - based on technology
- Toothpaste example
  - Sensory segment, children: flavour, appearance
  - Sociable segment, teens, young people: fresh breath
  - Warrior segment, large families: performance
  - Independent segment, men: cheap
- Segmenting Business Markets

### Requirement for effective segmentation 

- segment attractiveness
  - identifiable (boolean)
    - something that's hard to measure
    - most people are identifiable
  - reachable (boolean)
    - almost everybody is reachable
  - substantial and profitable (boolean)
    - size matters to a point
    - too small and it can be insignificant
    - corporations: focusing energy
  - responsive (boolean)
    - customers must:
      - react positively to firm's offering
      - move toward the firms products/services
      - accept the firm's value proposition
- keep the segment if (identifiable && reachable && substantial and profitable && responsive)
- evaluating market segments
  - segment size and growth
    - % of the population
    - how many competitors does this segment have?
  - segment structural attractiveness
  - company objectives and resources

### Positioning

- Repositioning a product
  - exceptionally hard
  - can make a new product instead
- Positioning competitively: product positioning
  - defined by consumers planned by marketers
  - "mind share" it occupies: what percentage of my mind does a brand occupy, this is exceptionally different to change. If the product is "low fat", you have to emphasize it over and over again, this is what positiong is about
  - is like Cement
- **Positioning is the design and implementation of a real mix to create an image of the brand in the customer's mind relative to its *competitors*.**
- Quick formula:
  - for (target customer)
  - who (statement of the need or opprotunity): who has this need
  - the (product name) is a (product category)
  - that (statement of key benefit - why buy)
  - unlike (primary competitive option): unlike doing it on your own/using another brand/service
  - out product (statement of key differentiation): key point, all your customer analysis goes into this statement, and the product has to be:
    - something your customer wants
    - something you do really well
    - something that is unique
- Consider Subway sandwiches:
  - over 18 years ago, consumers told them they wanted "freash and healthy"
  - but Subway increased business but not everyone else
  - what customers really wanted: "low fat"
  - "low fat" is the thing that's unique about Subway
  - Positioning
    - for young urban professionals that are 21-39 years old, have average income, post secondary education, most likely married, and health conscious and desire more in life
    - who are looking to eat fast healthy options when eating out
    - Subway sandwiches is a Quick Serve restaurant
- Positioning strategy: possible competitive advantages
  - value (prive/qualitty)
    - save money, live better (walmart)
  - product attributes/differentiation
    - so good (KFC)
  - benefit and symbolism
    - because I'm worth it (Loreal)
  - against competition (I am better)
    - tough on grease ... soft on hands (Polmolive)
- five steps:
  1. consumer preception vs competition
  2. identify competitive positions
     - figure out where everybody sits
     - A&W: no hormones
     - Harveys: make "your" burger
  3. determine consumer preferences
     - what are the consumers looking for
     - A&W: consumers care about their health
  4. select the position
     - once you get it, you do not change
     - if you keep changing it, you will confuse consumers
     - what you stand for
  5. monitor the positioning strategy
- Famoso pizza positioning
  - for:
  - who:
  - Famoso pizza
  - that:
  - unlike:
  - Famoso pizza
- Communicating and delivering the chosen position
  - easier to develop than implement
  - it takes a concentrated long term effort to make positioning work
  - **consistency is key**
    - don't change it every year
    - counter example: CMA campaign
- Describe the target market of Johnson's baby shampoo:
  - demographic: parents with babies
  - geographic: Canadian market place
  - psychographic: 
  - behaviourial: could be new parents that constantly asks others for advices, people who believe in Johson's Baby
- What is the most critical business concept and why?
  - your target market!

1. example: buying an iPhone (can answer using the following chart)

|                            | importance                                                   | explanation                                                  | what should we do? notes                                     | what should we do? example |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| need recognition           | what will help trigger their need reflex                     | functional or psychological needs                            | promotional tool - advertisement, event, etc. use the differentiating strategy, has to tie back to a functional/psychological need |                            |
| information search         | how do we get on the radar screen for the potential client   | internal vs external searches benefits vs risk locus of control | where do customers look when they are searching for information? - friends who have iPhones, tech blods, store, etc. |                            |
| evaluation of alternatives | how and what will we need to keep in mind wih this to ensure they can make a decision? | determinant attributes consumer decision rules: compensatory, noncompensatory, decision heuristics/imp | what is the most important to the consumer? make sure that the tech specs/attributes are available and provide a chart where consumers can compare this product vs other products, give this to sales people or put it on your website |                            |
| purchase decision          | this seems simple but is it really?                          | availability, ease, customer service                         | figure out what the customer want to do (to pay for it), available online/instore, talk about warranties, a risk free purchase, etc. |                            |

### Chapter 7

- what is forecasting?
  - judgement call on *demand* based on certain *criteria* over a *given period of time* for a specific product
  - based on demand instead of what you are going to sell
  - criteria: past sales, growth in the industry, growth in population
  - next month/next quarter/next year
  - for a specific product: e.g. not for the Purell:copyright: brand, but for a certain Purell product. e.g. every single product has a unique barcode
- why is it important?
  - production
  - how many employees you need
  - financial situation, how much money you need
- how do we do it?
