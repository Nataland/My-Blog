### Positioning
- the centre 
- why Jack Astors is not the same as Boston Pizza
- key: relative to competitors

### Develop Consumer Value
- Operational excellence
    - faster, more efficient
    - e.g. Walmart (bought a satellite)
- Product excellence
    - “me too” is not going to take you very far
    - need to create something unique
    - you can charge more, and people will be willing to pay for it
    - e.g. Lexus: great product quality
- Locational excellence
	- makes a huge difference because there are many options & online retailing
	- McDonald's, Tim Hortons
- Customer excellence
    - why you keep returning to your favourite restaurant
    - e.g. Costco, Nordstrom

Marketing is not about what's happened, it's about what you predict

- Market penetration
  - existing target market, same product: get more people to buy more, or attract new customers within the same target market
  - take your existing products and bundle them to get someone to buy more
  - e.g. Tim Horton's Roll up the Rim
- Product development
  - existing target market, new product
  - develop a new product like Apple Watch
  - e.g. Tim Horton's add latte to their product line
- Market development
  - new target market, same product
  - develop a new market like the senior market
  - e.g. People can get a meal at Tim Horton's
- Diversification
  - new target market, new product
  - completely new product
  - e.g. Tim Horton's gluten free menu

Next week: target marketing: which consumers in the market are the right ones to go to
You cannot traget everybody. 
e.g. to target the senior market, add benches to supermarkets
Understand your target market, change your products according to your market
Read the positioning document and come prepped for the quiz

# Week 2

### Post Sink: Companywide Strategic Planning

- Setting Company Objectives and Goals
- The goal of your company is to become the number one brand for Smart Phones (SOM & Sales) by Dec 31,2021
- currently #4 behind Samsung and Apple

Marketing Objectives:

- Who are my competitors?
- Perceptual Map
- Strategy: penetration, product development, market development, diversification
- location(place)

### Target Consumers (STP - Segmenting-targeting-positioning)

- The most critical business concept, 100% on the midterm & final

- Once you know your target market, the only other mantra is **execution**

- Gives you a direction: who are my customers? (identifying customers) how do I talk to them?

- Market segmentation (step 2)

  - **Geographic**
    - Where customers live
    - Where you should open you stores, etc. Important!!
    - *North America, Asia, Europe, Africa*
    - *Atlantic, Central, Western Canada*
  - **Demographic**
    - Age, education, income, etc.
    - Most commonly used, easy to do
    - One of the worst ways you can segment the market: purchase behaviour is different from demographic
    - *Age, gender, income, occupation, ethnic, background, religion, etc.*
  - **Psychographic**
    - The best one, toughist, challenging to understand
    - The way people think typically translates into how they buy
    - Explains: why do you do what you do?
    - *Lifestyles, values*
    - *Innovators, thinkers, achievers, etc.* 
  - **Behavioural**
    - The way people act
    - How loyal are they to a brand, are they a heavy user of a brand, what they normally do
    - e.g. convenience oriented customers
    - *Benefits Sought, Loyalty or Usage Patterns*
    - *Convenience, economy, prestige,*
    - *Completely loyal, not loyal, somewhat loyal*

- Market targeting

- Market positioning

- 5 steps (steps leading up to developing the correct positioning/STP):

  1. **Strategy or objectives** (always start with objectives: what are we trying to achieve) - Segmentation
  2. **Segmentation base** - Segmentation
  3. **Evaluate segment attractiveness** - Targeting
  4. **Select target market** - Targeting
  5. **Identify and develop positioning strategy** - Positioning

- Another way (from top to bottom: segmentation -> targeting -> positioning)

  1. take market and divide up into homogeneous segments
     - online shopping example: homogeneous groups of different sizes
     - e.g. younger people & seniors
  2. describe/profile each resulting segment
     - Dove advertisement example: people who had pressure to look a certain way
     - Budweiser advertisement example: target market is women, puppies, horses, good-looking men, but did not connect
  3. evaluate and then rank each segments attractiveness
  4. select the most appropriate target segments
  5. develop positioning for each target segment
  6. develop marketing mix for each target segment

- Describing a tarket market:

  - BMW: for performance
  - Volvo: safety, parents
  - Sunlife commercial: targeting people who dont like their jobs

- Give your target market a name (will lose marks if you don't)

  - e.g. hard-working moms

- Selecting market segments
  - **undifferentiated marketing**
    - nobody uses this now
  - **differentiated marketing**
    - most mass companies
    - a few segments
  - **concentrated marketing**
    - smaller companies
    - one segment
  - **customized marketing**
    - 1-to-1 marketing
    - based on technology
- Toothpaste example
  - Sensory segment, children: flavour, appearance
  - Sociable segment, teens, young people: fresh breath
  - Warrior segment, large families: performance
  - Independent segment, men: cheap
- Segmenting Business Markets

### Requirement for effective segmentation 

- segment attractiveness
  - identifiable (boolean)
    - something that's hard to measure
    - most people are identifiable
  - reachable (boolean)
    - almost everybody is reachable
  - substantial and profitable (boolean)
    - size matters to a point
    - too small and it can be insignificant
    - corporations: focusing energy
  - responsive (boolean)
    - customers must:
      - react positively to firm's offering
      - move toward the firms products/services
      - accept the firm's value proposition
- keep the segment if (identifiable && reachable && substantial and profitable && responsive)
- evaluating market segments
  - segment size and growth
    - % of the population
    - how many competitors does this segment have?
  - segment structural attractiveness
  - company objectives and resources

### Positioning

- Repositioning a product
  - exceptionally hard
  - can make a new product instead
- Positioning competitively: product positioning
  - defined by consumers planned by marketers
  - "mind share" it occupies: what percentage of my mind does a brand occupy, this is exceptionally different to change. If the product is "low fat", you have to emphasize it over and over again, this is what positiong is about
  - is like Cement
- **Positioning is the design and implementation of a real mix to create an image of the brand in the customer's mind relative to its *competitors*.**
- Quick formula:
  - for (target customer)
  - who (statement of the need or opprotunity): who has this need
  - the (product name) is a (product category)
  - that (statement of key benefit - why buy)
  - unlike (primary competitive option): unlike doing it on your own/using another brand/service
  - out product (statement of key differentiation): key point, all your customer analysis goes into this statement, and the product has to be:
    - something your customer wants
    - something you do really well
    - something that is unique
- Consider Subway sandwiches:
  - over 18 years ago, consumers told them they wanted "freash and healthy"
  - but Subway increased business but not everyone else
  - what customers really wanted: "low fat"
  - "low fat" is the thing that's unique about Subway
  - Positioning
    - for young urban professionals that are 21-39 years old, have average income, post secondary education, most likely married, and health conscious and desire more in life
    - who are looking to eat fast healthy options when eating out
    - Subway sandwiches is a Quick Serve restaurant
- Positioning strategy: possible competitive advantages
  - value (prive/qualitty)
    - save money, live better (walmart)
  - product attributes/differentiation
    - so good (KFC)
  - benefit and symbolism
    - because I'm worth it (Loreal)
  - against competition (I am better)
    - tough on grease ... soft on hands (Polmolive)
- five steps:
  1. consumer preception vs competition
  2. identify competitive positions
     - figure out where everybody sits
     - A&W: no hormones
     - Harveys: make "your" burger
  3. determine consumer preferences
     - what are the consumers looking for
     - A&W: consumers care about their health
  4. select the position
     - once you get it, you do not change
     - if you keep changing it, you will confuse consumers
     - what you stand for
  5. monitor the positioning strategy
- Famoso pizza positioning
  - for:
  - who:
  - Famoso pizza
  - that:
  - unlike:
  - Famoso pizza
- Communicating and delivering the chosen position
  - easier to develop than implement
  - it takes a concentrated long term effort to make positioning work
  - **consistency is key**
    - don't change it every year
    - counter example: CMA campaign
- Describe the target market of Johnson's baby shampoo:
  - demographic: parents with babies
  - geographic: Canadian market place
  - psychographic: 
  - behaviourial: could be new parents that constantly asks others for advices, people who believe in Johson's Baby
- What is the most critical business concept and why?
  - your target market!

### Factors affecting consumer decision process

- psychological factors
  - perception
    - process by which people
      - select, organize and interpret information
      - to form a meaningful picture of the world
        - selective exposure: we select the shows etc. we engage in
        - selective attention: we pay attention only to those items that we want to
        - selective comprehension
        - selective retention
  - attitudes: a person's consistently favourable or unfavourable evaluations, feelings, and tendencies toward an object or idea
  - three components:
    1. cognitive - reflects what we believe to be true
    2. affective - how we feel about it
    3. behavioural - comprise the actions we take on an issue
- situational factors
  - store atmosphere
    - Apple Store
    - impact of smell on shopping behaviour: certain smells will keep you
    - engage all five senses: sight, sound, smell, touch, taste
  - sales people
  - crowding
  - demonstrations
  - promotions
  - packaging
- social factors
  - family
  - culture
    - the Rant (ad)
    - culture is more often a source of conflict than of synergy. cultural differences are a nuisance at best and often a disaster
    - There is a significant between Canada and the World
  - roommates
  - significant other
  - having kids
  - reference group (give you options to consider): 
- **marketing mix** (4Ps)
  - will have an impact

### consumer buying process

1. problem/need recognition 
2. information search
3. evaluation of alternatives
4. purchase decision
5. postpurchase behaviour

# Week 4

1. example: buying an iPhone (can answer using the following chart)

|                            | importance                                                   | explanation                                                  | what should we do? notes                                     | what should we do? example |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| need recognition           | what will help trigger their need reflex                     | functional or psychological needs                            | promotional tool - advertisement, event, etc. use the differentiating strategy, has to tie back to a functional/psychological need |                            |
| information search         | how do we get on the radar screen for the potential client   | internal vs external searches benefits vs risk locus of control | where do customers look when they are searching for information? - friends who have iPhones, tech blods, store, etc. |                            |
| evaluation of alternatives | how and what will we need to keep in mind wih this to ensure they can make a decision? | determinant attributes consumer decision rules: compensatory, noncompensatory, decision heuristics/imp | what is the most important to the consumer? make sure that the tech specs/attributes are available and provide a chart where consumers can compare this product vs other products, give this to sales people or put it on your website |                            |
| purchase decision          | this seems simple but is it really?                          | availability, ease, customer service                         | figure out what the customer want to do (to pay for it), available online/instore, talk about warranties, a risk free purchase, etc. |                            |

on the exam, make definitive decisions on what you are going to do: e.g. review site.

make assumptions, assume it is going to work, as long as there is some logical thinking before your decisions.

2. identify and describe the 3 social factors that influence the consumer decision process. Provide an example example of how each of these might influence the purchase of the necessary products and services for a family vacation :airplane:
   1. family: family/a family member's preference
   2. reference groups: talk to someone, takes their advice: destination; a famour person
   3. culture: destination, size of travel group

## Chapter 7

### what is forecasting?

- judgement call on *demand* based on certain *criteria* over a *given period of time* for a specific product
- based on demand instead of what you are going to sell
- criteria: past sales, growth in the industry, growth in population
- next month/next quarter/next year
- for a specific product: e.g. not for the Purell:copyright: brand, but for a certain Purell product. e.g. every single product has a unique barcode

### why is it important?

- production
- how many employees you need
- financial situation, how much money you need

- how do we do it?

> You have just joined Colgate Palmolive as a new Assistant Brand Manager working on a established dishwashing liquid-Palmolive. Your manager is away and the director of marketing has asked you for the brand's forecast for next year. Palmolive has sold a consistent amount of litres over the past 5 years, except for last year. Last year the volume increased by 25% for no apparent reason!

> You just launched a new company/division for your parent firm KIDS ARE IT.

### Potential forecast Development

- Research is needed to get a valid number

| Canada's population                                          |      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---- |
| Kids ages 5-9 years old                                      |      |

## Market research

The single most important reason for undertaking market research, is to improve the quality of managerial decision-making, reducing risk of business management.       

####  When to do research

- When data will be useful in a   specific way
- You can get access to the information   
  - pp. will answer questions   ·        
- **You need to make an informed decision (budget)**    ·        
- **Need the info to helps others with a decision**

#### When not to do research

- If the financial analysis is not done
- When you want to avoid making the decision
- Research results are not going to change the plans
- Cheaper to try idea then research it 
- **Cannot expand research results to market (ie. Test market)**

#### Using marketing info systems to create better value

Marketing information system (MIS)

Data warehouse

Data mining – data is power        

#### The marketing research process

Kraft video  

1. **Defining research objective** 
2. **Design the research plan** 
   - start from secondary data to get point and then move to primary data to get better success (in exam)
3. **Data collection process** 
   absolutely ambiguity   - - - - uncertainty - - - -  complete certainty 
   exploratory research   - - - - conclusive research - - -  experimental research Qualitative vs quantitative data collection
   - qualitative research techniques – subjective
     - observation 
     - in-depth interview 
     - focus group
     - social media 
   - Quantitative research techniques 
     - experiments
       - systematic manipulation 
     - survey
     - scanner 
     - panel 
   - Famoso Pizza uses social media research 
     - Pro – 
     - Con - 
   - The “best” research design 
     - There are never a single, standard, correct method of carrying out a piece if research….
     - There are many ways to tackle a problem…
     - A research method for a given problem is not like the solution to a problem in algebra 
     - It is more like a recipe for beef stroganoff 
4. **Analyzing data**  
5. **Present action plans**
   - executive summary 
   - Body 
   - Conclusion 
   - Limitations
   - Supplements 
   - tables figure 
   -  appendixes 

> A complete research effect Kit Kat Chocolate bar 

- Issue – losing appeal among younger consumer 
- Qualitative **in-depth interview** follow with **focus group**/usage research to make new form bar. 

**What might have helped create this product** 

- Secondary data  
- Focus group 

# Week 5

### Post Sink

> A new men's clothing store is trying to determine if there is a significant market for its type of mechandise in a specific location where it is considering putting a store. Would it be most likely to use primary or secondary data, or a combination of the two, to answer this question and what examples would you suggest?

- always start with secondary data (demographic, competitors)
- also need primary research
- determine what I need to know -> what research method

### Measuring Success of Strategic Decisions

Introduction MY income statements (7 elements)

- gross sales
  - are the entire dollar amount if the item was sold at full value (list price or full retail price) for the goods sold during a given period
  - total sales figure
- customer returns and allowances (CR&A)
  - return - merchandise returned to stock for a refund/credit
    - quality control issue if there are a lot of return
    - thus a need to generate a report for returns
  - allowance - a price reduction at time of sale
    - question: why are we offering so many discounts
- net sales
  - gross sales - CR&A = net sales
- cost of goods sold
- gross margin
  - net sales - COGS = gross margin
- operating expenses
  - variable & fixed expenses
  - variable: varies directly with sales of unites
  - fixed: whether you sell 1 unit or 100 it is the same (e.g. salary, advertising, etc.)
- NIBITDA (net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) or EBITDA (earnings before ...)
  - gross margin - operating expenses = NIBITDA

|               | dollars | % of net sales* |
| ------------- | ------- | --------------- |
| Gross sales   |         |                 |
| CR&A          |         |                 |
| Net sales     |         |                 |
| COGS          |         |                 |
| Gross margin  |         |                 |
| Opearting exp |         |                 |
| NIBITDA       |         |                 |

*: for bonus!

### Business Metrics Discussion

- why is this information important?
  - gives you insight in your business
  - gives you a story (at one point in time)
  - it is not cash flow
  - look at ways to grow your top line/bottom line

|               | dollars | % of net sales |
| ------------- | ------- | -------------- |
| Gross sales   | 9435    | n/a            |
| CR&A          | 1200    | n/a            |
| Net sales     | 8235    | 100.00%        |
| COGS          | 4505    | 54.71%         |
| Gross margin  | 3730    | 45.29%         |
| Opearting exp | 800     | 9.71%          |
| NIBITDA       | 2930    | 35.58%         |

A key point to remember:

- **shift** over time ...
  - who we are
  - our financial stability
  - competitors
  - demographics
  - social norms ... etc
- look at shifts as opportunities that marketers can take advantage of

## Chapter 3

### Marketing environments

the factors and forces outside marketing's direct control that affect marketing management's ability to develop and maintain successful transactions with its target customers

- outside the control of a marketer
- impacts the ability of marketers to connect
- "work in" vs "work on" your business

#### Micro environment

- a marketer or marketing department must collaborate with others to achive results

#### Immediate environment

- suppliers can provide more than just resources
- need to work with suppliers to drive costs out of the system but also improve quality
- supplier and market pricing trends impact the company

### Microenviroment

Competition:

- competitors - why do I care?
- competitor myopia? Pepsi is not CocaCola's only competitor

### Macroenvironment - "shift in"

- there is nothing you can do to change it, need to react
- cultural impact:
  - name and language on material
  - e.g. coke vs pop vs soda

  - became more multi-cultural
  - opportunity: halal restaurant/supermarket
  - family sizes (having fewer children)
  - getting married older
  - age shift
  - income shift
  - increased life expectancy
  - ...
- 5 distinct generations (can have 5 generations at the workplace)
  - traditionalists (our grandparents): 1900-1946, build a legacy
  - baby boomers: 1947-1965, build a stellar career
  - generation X: 1966-1978, build a portable career
  - generation Y or millennials: 1979-2000, build a parallel career
  - generation Z: 1995-2009, build social "network", getting connected, learning

### Impact

- raised minimum wage
  - significant impact
  - without raising to 15: can hire more people
  - raising to 15: prices will raise, more automation, McDonald's increase of Kiosks
- the world wide economy was shocked - businesses prepare for a recession
- the Bank of Canada continues to raise its prime rate after years of decline. What effect does thi rate have on the Canadian economy?
  - value of the dollar
    - exporters & importers
    - tourism

### Social trends

- healthy living
- green
