## Employment Law

> A contractual relationship whereby one party, the employer, is authorized to direct and control the work of another party, the employee

- Contract between parties = employment agreement
	- Can be for continuous service
	- Can be for fixed term

- Governed by:
	- Statute
	- Labour Union- Common Law

- Compared with agency:
	- same person can be both employee and agency
	- agent: no recourse against a principal that terminates the agreement without notice
	- employee: often has a right of action for damages for wrongful dismissal in comparable circumstances
	- both may be liable in tort for the acts
	- vicarious liability: employer > principal

- Compared with independent contractor:

	| Employment                                  | Independent Contractor               |
	|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
	| Degree of supervision & control over worker | Ownership of tools                   |
	| Duration of the K                           | Duration of the K                    |
	| Nature of the K                             | Nature of the K                      |
	| Intention at the time of K formation        | Intention at the time of K formation |
	| Method of payment                           | Method of payment                    |
	| Benefits                                    | Exclusivity                          |
	| Integration in the workplace                | Risk in profit/loss                  |
	|                                             | Use of time & delivery of result     |

### Torts
- Vicarious Liability
- Negligent Hiring
- Wrongful Referral

### Contracts
- Vicarious Performance

### Duties of the parties:
- Employee's duties:
	- Duty to obey
	- Duty to exercise skill and care
	- Duty of good faith and fidelity
- Employer's duties:
	- Duty to pay

### Termination of Employment K
- Employment contracts are often continuous in nature - so, how are they discharged?
- By way of notice
	- notice = time = $$
- How much notice is required?
	- Employment Standards Act, S.O.2000 c.41 - minimum requirements
	- Trade Practices - often suggest longer than minimum as normal within an industry
	- At common law - Reasonable notice
- Some factors for determining reasonable notice:
	- Trade practice
	- Duration of employment
	- Intention at time of K formation
	- Frequency of pay
	- Level of position
	- Character of employment
	- Age of employee
	- Education or training of employee
	- Experience of Employee
	- Availability of similar employment in the industry (market conditions)
- When is no notice required? -> dismissal for cause

### Dismissal for cause (dismissal without notice)
> Dismissal without notice or further obligation by the employer when the employee's conduct amounts to a breach of the contract

1. Misconduct:
	- Does not have to cause economic loss
	- Crimes - especially embezzlement (stealing from your employer) or theft
	- Bad behaviour:
		- Where reputation of employer is affected
		- Other employees are affected
		- Causes direct financial loss
2. Disobedience:
	- Willfully disobeying:
		- A reasonable, and
		- Lawful request
3. Incompetence
	- Need for implied or express term of competence
		- Express: stating in a resume that one possesses certain required skills
		- Implied: applying for a job that requires certain skills
	- Doctrine of Condonation applies - condoning incompetence makes a claim for dismissal for incompetence difficult
4. Illness
	- Not a breach of K - frustrating event
	- Role of employment insurance
	
#### Employer's role:
- Need for **warnings** to employee - providing the opportunity for the employee to improve their behaviour
- Progressive employee discipline: imposing increasingly serious consequences for each event of improper employee behaviour beginning with a warning and ending with dismissal
- Need to provide adequate training and assistance
- Need to document activities of both employer and employee
- burden of proof of the warning is on the employer
- only most serious events of cause entitle no warning:
	1. violating an essential term of the employment contract
	2. breaching the faith inherent in the relationship
	3. fundamentally or directly conflicting with the employee's obligations to the employer

### Wrongful Dismissal
> Where an employee claims they have been wrongfully dismissed

- Employer's defence:
	- Employee was dismissed for cause; or
	- Adequate Notice was provided
- NB if cause is discovered AFTER the dismissal, the employer can use this in their defence
- Constructive Dismissal = Wrongful Dismissal
- Proving Adequate Notice - Factors considered by the court as per Bardal v. Globe and Mail:
	- Character of the employment
	- Length of service
	- Age of the employee
	- Availability of similar employment
	- Experience, training and qualifications of employee
	- Whether the employee was induced to leave secure
	employment
	- Bad faith on the part of the employer
	- Expenses incurred seeking other employment
- Contract law - place the injured party in the position s/he would’ve been had the contract been performed
- A reasonable timeframe is required to fulfill this purpose, hence the role of Notice
- Once the court sets the reasonable notice period e.g. 6 months:
	- (Rate of pay + Benefits) X Notice = $$$
- Mitigation:
	- Contract law requirement to act reasonably to reduce losses
	- (the dismissed employee) Must try to obtain reasonably comparable employment
	- Court will reduce damages award if there is a failure to mitigate
	- If a plaintiff (employee) successfully mitigates, they receive the difference between Notice and income as damages
- Mental Anguish:
	- Courts generally do not consider hurt feelings
	- Recognition over time that while employment contracts are economic in nature, there is decidedly a human element as well
	- Problems of trying to assess intangibles such as “pain and suffering” and “humiliation”
- Wallace v. United Grain Growers Ltd. [1997] 3 S.C.R. 313
- Reinstatement (give back the position)
	- Court orders the employer to continue to employ the aggrieved employee
	- Equitable remedy
	- Impersonal nature of large corporations
	- Canada Labour Code R.S.C. 1985, c. L-2 s.240 - for federally regulated companies
	- Provincial legislation - Quebec, Nova Scotia

#### Summary:
1. Damages:
	- payment in lieu (loo, replacement) of notice
	- damages for mental anguish or pain and suffering
	- special damages associated with the cost of mitigation
	- punitive damages from an employer acting in bad faith
	- reduction for failure to mitigate their damages
2. Reinstatement

### Employee Welfare Legislation
- Human Rights - private sector
	- employers: must comply with the human rights legislations
	- must ensure others in the workplace do the same
- Charter of Rights and Freedoms - government
- Pay Equity Legislation - equal pay for equal work
- Employment Equity Legislation- federal only
- Regulation of working conditions - ESA, Labour codes, Health and Safety
	- statutory minimum wage (varies with the industry)
	- limited working hours with some exceptions
	- annual vacations with pay
- Employment Insurance Act - insurance against unemployment
- Worker's compensation:
	- Employer's defence in the common law: the injury
		1. resulted from the contributory negligence of the employer
		2. was caused by the negligence of a fellow employee, provided the employer took reasonablecare to hire competent workers
		3. was an **assumed risk**, accepted by the employee as a nromal incident of the type of work he had agreed to do
	- No fault compensation scheme
	- Applies to certain industries
	- Employers are required to pay into the fund
	- Injured employee can apply to the fund except if it was the employee’s wilful misconduct that caused the injury - exception: death or permanent disability	
	- Occupational Health: prevention of harm and occupational safety

### Which of the following is **NOT** true about terminating an employee?
- **An employer must always give reasonable notice as set out in the Employment Standards Act** 
	- Anyone can be fired, and there is no way to prevent being fired
	- Incompetence -> warn you along the way, even try to fix you
	- Reasonable notice is not set out in the Employment Standards Act
- An employer need not give reasonable notice if there is "cause" for dismissal
- An employer may be considered to have terminated an employee even if the employee quit when transferred to a new job
- None of the above
