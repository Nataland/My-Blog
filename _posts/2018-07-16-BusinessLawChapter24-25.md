# 1. Sole proprietorships
> an unincorporated business owned by a single individual

- as soon as an individual starts doing business
- no formality
- must keep proper accounts
- income reported on the personal income tax

# 2. Partnerships
> the relationship between two or more persons carrying on a business with a view to profit

**Elements**:
1. a relationship,=
	- consensual and contractual
	- usually written partnership agreement, signed
2. between persons,
3. carrying on business in common,
	- not charitable enterprises
	- "carrying on", not one purchase/sale
4. with a view to profit.
	- evidence: receipt of a share of the profits of the business
		
## The nature of partnership
- Advantage: pool of knowledge, skills and physical and financial resources
- Disadvantage:
	- disagreements
	- dishonesty or incompetence of one member -> loss of other members
	- wastes time reaching an agreement
- The Partnership Act
- The legal nature of partnership
	- legal personality - PARTNERSHIP, no legal identity (no independent existence)
- The continuing relationship between partners
	- when one partner leaves (death/insolvency), the Partnership Act accepts that the partners may agree that the partnership should continue
- Partnership property
	- partners do not own the property itself, but an interest in that property
- Creditors of the firm
	- creditors have first call against partnership assets before the personal creditors of an individual partner
- Legal Proceedings
	- court action: partnership -> separate entity
	- the partnership can bring action itself, without naming all thez partners as plaintiffs
	- the partnership can be sued
	- it's better to sue the partnership rather than the partners

## The creation of a partnership
- The partnership agreement
	- terms should not be illegal and offend public policy
	- oral can be valid and enforceable
	- purpose: set out the entire terms of the relationship
	- contents:
		- identity of the partners
		- name of the firm
		- nature of the business to be carried on
		- duration of the relationship
		- method of terminating the partnership
		- rules for introducing new partners
		- what is to happen on the retirement or death of an existing partner
		- participation in management and in making major decisions
		- contribution of each partner in terms of work and responsibilities
		- capital contribution of each partner
		- ownership of property used in the business
		- sharing of profits and losses
		- procedure for resolving disputes
- Registration
	- not required for general partnerships, but declaration (essential information) is required by most provinces
	- required for limited partnerships and limited liability partnerships

## The liability of a partner （contract & tort)
- Partners are personally liable for debts and liabilities
- Contractual Liability
	- Agency principles
	> Every partner is an agent of the firm and his other partners for the purpose of the business of the partnership
	- Joint liability
	> Every partner in a firm is liable jointly with the other partners for all debts and obligations of the firm incurred while he is a partner
		- any partner is liable for the full amount of the firm's debt
		- therefore, plaintiff should sue the partnership rather than some partners
	- Apparent partners
		- a person is liable only for stuff while he is partner
		- just entered partnership -> not liable for stuff happened before
		- retired from partnership -> still liable for stuff while he was there
		- retired but third party still believes he's a partner -> may be liable, therefore, to retire:
			- ensure that all existing clients of the firm are notified
			- place a notice in the official gazette of the province (and perhaps also in the local newspaper)
			- ensure that his name is removed from the register
			- ensure to the best of his ability that any letterheads are destroyed or altered to remove his name
		- novation: agreement
- Tort and breach of trust
	- firm including all partners liable for injuries/damages caused by a partner doing the firm's business
	- defamatory statement, negligence, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of trust (committed by a partner)
	- Misapplication of funds:
		1. X entrusts P with money or property to be handed over to the firm (F); instead, P keeps the money or property for himself.
		2. X entrusts money or property to the firm, and it is subsequently misappropriated by P.
	- similar to vicarious liability

## The relationship between partners
- contractual relationship
- terms: in argeement / the Partnership act
- one partner's breach of contract -> compensate other partners
- implied terms (applicable if not in the partnership agreement):
	- partnership property (must be held and applied by the partners exclusively for the purposes of the partnership, according to the agreement)
	- financial arrangements (presumptions with respect to capital and profits, can be varied)
		1. all the partners are entitled to share equally in the capital and profits of the business and must contribute equally towards the losses, whether of capital or otherwise, sustained by the firm
		2. if a partner incurs expenses or personal liabilities (due to the business), or in doing anything to preserve the business or property of the firm, the firm must indemnify (excuse or prevent .. from) him for these expenses or liabilities
		3. a partner is not entitled, before the determination of profits, to interest on the capital subscribed by him
		4. no partner is entitled to remuneration (reward money) for acting in the partnership business
			- periodic payments (in agreement)
	- conduct of the business
		1. every partner may take part in the management of the partnership business
		2. any difference arising as to ordinary matters connected with the partnership business may be decided by a majority of the partners, but no change may be made in the nature of the partnership business without the consent of all existing partners
			- serious disagreement -> troublesome
		3. the partnership books kept at place of business, every partner should have access to
	- membership
		1. no person may be introduced as a partner without the consent of all existing partners
		2. no patner may assign his share in the partnership so that other people can interfere with the partnership
- Fiduciary duties
	1. partners -> true information, all thing affecting partnership -> other partners / legal representatives
	2. secret benefits - disclose / authorize benefits
	3. duty not to compete -> partner opens another business of the same nature, must give profit to original firm

## Termination of partnership
- express provision: what happens on termination?
- implied statutory rules: in absence of express agreement
	1. termination by notice or expiry
		- e.x. partnership for a fixed term, partnership at will
	2. termination on death of insolvency
		- death of a partner -> terminates
		- agreement can say even someone died partnership still continues
		- financial problems > legal problems
		- one partner's death -> partnership's property to be charged; other partners -> terminate
	3. dissolution by law
		- it's unlawful toe be carried on -> terminates
		- a partner is incompetent, incapable, guilty of conduct, breaches agreement
		- it's just to dissolve
- effects of dissolution - sequence of payments:
	1. payment of the debts of the firm owed to non-partners
	2. repayment of loans made to the firm by partners
	3. repayment of the capital contributed by partners
	4. sharing any surplus among the partners according to their entitlement to share in profits

## Limited Liability partnerships
> a partnership in which non-negligent partners are not personally liable for losses caused by the negligence of a partner

- a partner remains liable for his own negligent acts or omissions & people under his supervision/control
- injured party cannot take assets of the non-negligent partners
- agreement: partnership -> LLP, LLP in the firm name

## Limited partnerships
- LLP != limited partnership:
	- limited partnership: at least one general partner who has unlimited liability
	- limited partners in limited partnership lose their limited liability if in management
	- limited partnerships are not restricted to the professions (?)

## Joint ventures
> an agreement between two or more parties (often corporations) to collaborate on the management of a specific project, to each contribute a part of their respective resources and to share the profits

- spreads the risk
- **contractual joint venture**: a joint venture effected by agreement without the creation of any separate legal entity
- (alternate) **equity joint venture**: a corporation formed, and jointly owned, by the parties to a joint venture for the purpose of carrying on the venture

## Income trusts
- transfer of income-producing assets from the operating company to a trust
- created by the **declaration of trust**:  an agreement that establishes a truwst and designates the trustees
- operating company: manages assets under the supervision of trustees
- income: distributed by the trust to unitholders (not shareholders)
	- unitholders should have limited liability;
	- unitholders should be entitled to elect trustees;
	- unitholders should have the same remedies as shareholders; and
	- trustees should have the same powers, duties, and liability as directors of a corporation.
