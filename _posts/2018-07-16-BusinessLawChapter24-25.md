# 1. Sole proprietorships
> an unincorporated business owned by a single individual

- as soon as an individual starts doing business
- no formality
- must keep proper accounts
- income reported on the personal income tax

# 2. Partnerships
> the relationship between two or more persons carrying on a business with a view to profit

**elements**:
1. a relationship,
	- consensual and contractual
	- usually written partnership agreement, signed
2. between persons,
3. carrying on business in common,
	- not charitable enterprises
	- "carrying on", not one purchase/sale
4. with a view to profit.
	- evidence: receipt of a share of the profits of the business
		
## The nature of partnership
- Advantage: pool of knowledge, skills and physical and financial resources
- Disadvantage:
	- disagreements
	- dishonesty or incompetence of one member -> loss of other members
	- wastes time reaching an agreement
- The Partnership Act
- The legal nature of partnership
	- legal personality - PARTNERSHIP, no legal identity (no independent existence)
- The continuing relationship between partners
	- when one partner leaves (death/insolvency), the Partnership Act accepts that the partners may agree that the partnership should continue
- Partnership property
	- partners do not own the property itself, but an interest in that property
- Creditors of the firm
	- creditors have first call against partnership assets before the personal creditors of an individual partner
- Legal Proceedings
	- court action: partnership -> separate entity
	- the partnership can bring action itself, without naming all the partners as plaintiffs
	- the partnership can be sued
	- it's better to sue the partnership rather than the partners
