Privity of contract: the relationship between parties to a contract

### Exceptions to the privity rule:
- tort
- vicarious performance - someone does it for you
- exemption clauses
- trusts
    - trust fund baby - beneficiary of a trust
    - trust: pile of money/asset organized into a safe keeping vehicle
    - beneficiary may get some benefit (part of the money)
    - trustee - managing the money, has a document that sets out the rules
- insurance
- land

### The Unperformed promises in a contract (What does it mean to have contractual rights?)
- contractual rights -> money (ex. i want to sublet my apartment, sell a bond) not the burden of the asset
- i.e. you transferring the unperformed promise does not get rid of the burden
- benefit of the contract - what the other party still must do for you
- burden of the contract - what you still must do for the other party

### Assignment - transferring the right to collect the benefit of a contract to a third party (transferring that unperformed right, we use assignment instead of sell here)
- the third party can then enforce a contract that he was not a party to
- the first contract creates the choses in action and the second contract transfers the choses in action to a third party
- e.x. choses in action is created in the contract between the tenant and the land lord (first contract)

### Debt buyers - buy the accounts receivable from the lender
- the law of assignment says: when there is an unperformed right, the assignor is entitled to convey its right to collect its right against you to another party, then that party has the right to sue you
- promisor(you) <—contract1—> assignor(bank) <—contract2—> assignee(debt buyer)
- does the assignee has the right to sue the promisor? yes - according to 1

### Two types of assignment
- equitable assignment: transfer part of the benefit only and assignor must be a party to the lawsuit
    1. only giving away part of the benefit only
    2. e.x. you are only subletting out your apartment for 4 months. you should be part of anything thats going on between the sub tenant and the landlord.
    3. this one doesn’t require writing/notice because you are still involved
- statutory assignment: conveyancing law and property act
    1. absolute and unconditional - the whole thing, no hold backs
    2. writing - in writing
    3. notice - give notice to the landlord
- In either type of assignment, you do not get rid of the burden. Subletting example: you are still required to pay rent!

### Subject to the equities
- assignee can be in no stronger position in the lawsuit with the promisor than the assignor would have been.
- any defence that would have worked against the assignor works against the assignee. (the couch sucks!)

### Negotiable instruments (SUPAH assignment)
- special category of assignments
- bills of exchange act (money is sometimes called a bill)
- cheque, promissory note (money is sometimes called a note, it is the government of Canada’s promissory note - promise to pay. The paper itself is not worth the money printed on it)
- special rules or presentment
- not subject to the equities
- no need for notice
- innocent holder in due course protected

### The cheque example
- an assignment to redirect the money that the bank is supposed to pay me to pay someone else
- bank (promisor) <--> Person who wrote the cheque (assignor) <--> Person who can claim the cheque (assignee)
- bank: innocent holder in due course (the bank doesnt know why the assignee got the cheque)
- Joe Brown case

```
If I sublet the last four months of my lease:
1. The subtenant must involve me in his dealings with the land lord, OR
2. The subtenant may deal with the landlord directly provided I have given the landlord notice of the sublet and I am not coming back
```
