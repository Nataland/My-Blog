Privity of contract: the relationship between parties to a contract

1. liability of seller of goods
    - family of victim of food poisoning cannot sue food company, since the contract was between food company and victim
2. liability of manufactureres
    - manufacturer: negligence
    - duty of care extends well beyond the parties to the contract to include those persons that a reasonable person could foresee as likely being harmed
    - can sue in tort (but no contract)
    - builders, engineers, architects, and designers owe a duty of care to owners/occupants of the buildings they build
    - above examples: no privity -> cannot sue in contract -> can sue in tort

### Exceptions to the privity rule:
- tort
    
- vicarious performance - someone does it for you
    - a third party performs contractual obligations on behalf of the promisor who remains responsible for proper performance
        - A contract with B for B to perform, B lets C perform the job for it, if C failed, then:
        - A sue B for breach of contract
        - if it's due to C's negligence, then C is personally liable to A
        - B vicariously liable in tort for C's negligence
- exemption clauses: a clause in a contract that exempts or limits the liability of a party
- trusts: an arrangement that transfers property to a person who administers it for the benefit of another person
    - trust fund baby - beneficiary of a trust
    - trust: pile of money/asset organized into a safe keeping vehicle
    - beneficiary may get some benefit (part of the money) -> the third party
    - beneficiary entitled to enforce the terms of the trust (and there for an exception of the privity rule)
    - trustee - managing the money, has a document that sets out the rules
- insurance
    - a person pays a premium in exchange for a promise from the insurance company to pay a sum of money on his/her death to a specified person (third party to the insurance contract)
    - specified person: right to force the insurnace company to pay out the contract
- land
    - privity rule does not apply in land law
    - new owner are subject to rights/obligations in eariler contracts that he's not a part of
    - enurement clause: a clause in a contract that extends the rights and benefits to those inheriting from a party, succeeding the party, or taking an assignment from a party

### The Unperformed promises in a contract (What does it mean to have contractual rights?)
- contractual rights -> money (ex. i want to sublet my apartment, sell a bond) not the burden of the asset
- i.e. you transferring the unperformed promise does not get rid of the burden
- benefit of the contract - what the other party still must do for you
- burden of the contract - what you still must do for the other party

### Assignment - transferring the right to collect the benefit of a contract to a third party (transferring that unperformed right, we use assignment instead of sell here)
- the third party can then enforce a contract that he was not a party to
- the first contract creates the choses in action and the second contract transfers the choses in action to a third party
- **choses in action**: rights to intangible properties such as patents, stocks, and contracts that may be enforced in the courts
    - e.g. choses in action is created in the contract between the tenant and the land lord (first contract)
- **choses in possession**
    - e.g. rights to tangible property that may be possessed physically

### Debt buyers - buy the accounts receivable from the lender
- the law of assignment says: when there is an unperformed right, the assignor is entitled to convey its right to collect its right against you to another party, then that party has the right to sue you
- promisor(you) <—contract1—> assignor(bank) <—contract2—> assignee(debt buyer)
    - assignor: a party that assigns its rights under a contract to a third party
    - assignee: a third party to whom rights under a contract have been assigned
- does the assignee has the right to sue the promisor? yes - according to 1

### Credit cards
- you buy something at a store and give the clerk your master card to pay for the purchase
- you are the promisor, the store is the assignor and master card is the assignee
- promisor(you) <—contract1—> assignor(store) <—contract2—> assignee(master card) where you would pay back master card later

### Two types of assignment
- **equitable assignment**: transfer part of the benefit only and assignor must be a party to the lawsuit
    1. only giving away part of the benefit only
    2. e.x. you are only subletting out your apartment for 4 months. you should be part of anything thats going on between the sub tenant and the landlord.
    3. this one doesn’t require writing/notice because you are still involved
- **statutory assignment**: conveyancing law and property act
    1. absolute and unconditional - the whole thing, no hold backs
    2. writing - in writing
    3. notice - give notice to the landlord
- In either type of assignment, you do not get rid of the burden. Subletting example: you are still required to pay rent!

### Subject to the equities
- assignee can be in no stronger position in the lawsuit with the promisor than the assignor would have been.
    - promisor has the right to set off, i.e., deduct an existing debt owed to him by the promisee
- any defence that would have worked against the assignor works against the assignee. (the couch sucks!)
    - the couch sucks example: promisor buys a couch from assignor, refuses to pay the assignee because the couch sucks

### Assignments by operation of law
- death of a person
    - executor (representative selected by the deceased person)
    - administartor (representative appointed by court)
    - task: pay all just claims against the deceased
- bankruptcy
    - receiving order: a court order to commence bankruptcy proceedings

### Negotiable instruments (Super assignment)

> A written contract containing a promise, express or implied, to pay a specific sum of money to a designated person or to "bearer"

- special category of assignments
    - new holder acquires from the payee the rights and benefits of the instrument
- bills of exchange act (money is sometimes called a bill)
- cheque, promissory note (money is sometimes called a note, it is the government of Canada’s promissory note - promise to pay. The paper itself is not worth the money printed on it)
- special rules or presentment
- not subject to the equities
- no need for notice
- innocent holder in due course protected
    - an assignee for value of a negotiable instrument may succeed in an action against the promisor where the assignor himself would not have succeeded (key difference between assignment and negotiation)
- currency: more relaxed transferability and negotiation

### The cheque example
- an assignment to redirect the money that the bank is supposed to pay me to pay someone else
- bank (promisor) <--> Person who wrote the cheque (assignor) <--> Person who can claim the cheque (assignee)
- bank: innocent holder in due course (the bank doesnt know why the assignee got the cheque)
- Joe Brown case

```
If I sublet the last four months of my lease:
1. The subtenant must involve me in his dealings with the land lord, OR
2. The subtenant may deal with the landlord directly provided I have given the landlord notice of the sublet and I am not coming back
```
