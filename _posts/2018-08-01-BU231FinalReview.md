# Review problems:
You are in house legal counsel ABC Co., a non-unionized family owned company that provides warehouse storage services to customers who have temporary (less than one year) storage needs. You are asked for advice relating to a number of issues that have arisen lately: 

1. A customer is complaining that the couch they placed in storage suffered water damage while in the locked unit. The customer was the only one with access to the unit and no inventory of contents was made when the customer moved his goods into the unit. The customer locked the unit with his own combination lock. ABC Co. provides round the clock security by way of two guards and 3 security dogs that roam around the exterior premises which are fenced. Afterhours access can only be gained with the assistance of a security guard. Describe the law applicable to this situation and offer an opinion as to who will be liable for damage to the couch and why. The contract signed by the customer requires payment of $75.00 per month and states that stored items are at the owner's risk. (10 Marks) 

2. Jim is a security guard at ABC Co and he has been with the company for 25 years. He is turning 65 next month and the General Manage has told him that he must retire. He got upset and argued that he was being discriminated against. Advise the general manager on this issue specifically referring to any relevant legislation. (5 Marks) 

3. The company has a logo dating back to the founding of the business in 1896. It is a black check mark that is displayed on all of the signage, stationary, and uniforms of the business. Recently, the business created a website including the same logo and has received a letter from NIKE asking them to cease and desist from the use of the checkmark. Must they stop using it? Discuss the law relating to this issue including any relevant legislation? What should ABC have done to protect the use of the Checkmark? (10 marks) 

4. The 3 brothers each own 25% of the shares in the company and distant relatives own the remaining 25%. The brother always vote together in order to ensure the business is run the way they like. As always the 3 brother voted together to elect themselves to the board along with their spouses. Fifty thousand dollars of compensation for sitting on the board was also approved at the shareholders meeting with the brothers voting in favour and all other shareholders voting against. Compensation for sitting on a board is usual and the board had an independent compensation consultant's report to support the valuation. Still the minority shareholders are upset that their wishes were not being considered and believe that money should not be paid to both spouses. The directors want to know your opinion about their personal liability if any and what remedies might be pursued by the minority shareholders. (10 marks) 

## Q&A
1. A partnership is not a separate legal identity but can sue people and be sued?
	- can be sued in it's name
2. Regarding the differences between limited partmership and limited liability partnership: "limited partnerships are not restricted to the professions" - what does this mean?
	- you can only be LLP if you are a certain profession
	- limited partnership does not have this
3. Negotiable instrument
	- cheque
4. Employment contract:
	- "I don't have the money to hire you anymore" -> temporary suspension -> "I will rehire you when I have work", then the employee is suplemented with EI
	- If you don't do this, you fire with a cause and need a notice
5. Partial fiduciary duties:
	- LLP: owe fiduciary duty like a lawyer, you owe fiduciary duty to your own clients
6. Express vs Actual vs Apparent
