# Review problems:
You are in house legal counsel ABC Co., a non-unionized family owned company that provides warehouse storage services to customers who have temporary (less than one year) storage needs. You are asked for advice relating to a number of issues that have arisen lately: 

1. A customer is complaining that the couch they placed in storage suffered water damage while in the locked unit. The customer was the only one with access to the unit and no inventory of contents was made when the customer moved his goods into the unit. The customer locked the unit with his own combination lock. ABC Co. provides round the clock security by way of two guards and 3 security dogs that roam around the exterior premises which are fenced. Afterhours access can only be gained with the assistance of a security guard. Describe the law applicable to this situation and offer an opinion as to who will be liable for damage to the couch and why. The contract signed by the customer requires payment of $75.00 per month and states that stored items are at the owner's risk. (10 Marks) 

	- Is this bailment? (Change of posession without change of ownership.) Or is this just rental to use the space?
	- If bailment: then which level of standard of care?
	- If contract:
		- is that an exemption clause: exempting you from liability. (3 steps to determine whether an exemption clause is valid)
		- otherwise, is that a statement indicating the level of care?
	- Emphasize who is responsible to the couch:
		- ABC should say that I am not the bailee so I am not responsible for the goods
		- It's the journey that took you there (both valid)
			- I have my own lock -> not bailment
			- I can't access it because of the security guard and the dogs -> bailment

2. Jim is a security guard at ABC Co and he has been with the company for 25 years. He is turning 65 next month and the General Manage has told him that he must retire. He got upset and argued that he was being discriminated against. Advise the general manager on this issue specifically referring to any relevant legislation. (5 Marks) 

	- "retire": when you force someone to stop working, you are still firing them. 
	- yes, this is an issue of termination, not entitled to termination of cause. Not justified, must give reasonable notice.
	- Justifiable from a human right's prespective (Defence): Police, security guard, fire fighters etc. can be required to retire at 60. Under human rights legislation, age discrimination is a protected ground.
	- Wrongful dismissal, bardel factors
	- Emphasize on the law of discrimination
	- 10 marks: talk about three different things

3. The company has a logo dating back to the founding of the business in 1896. It is a black check mark that is displayed on all of the signage, stationary, and uniforms of the business. Recently, the business created a website including the same logo and has received a letter from NIKE asking them to cease and desist from the use of the checkmark. Must they stop using it? Discuss the law relating to this issue including any relevant legislation? What should ABC have done to protect the use of the Checkmark? (10 marks) 

	- trademark (hint: logo)
	- common law cause of action: **passing off**
		- if you can prove you have used this logo for a long period of time, then without you a trademark, the burden of proof is on you to prove that you have used this trademark on your products
		- in this case, company 1896 should sue Nike for "passing off"
		- storage business: should not be confusing with Nike, not confusingly similar (overlap: clothing, checkmark on uniforms vs checkmark on Nike clothing)
	- trade mark rules
		- they should have registered to protect their trademarks

4. The 3 brothers each own 25% of the shares in the company and distant relatives own the remaining 25%. The brother always vote together in order to ensure the business is run the way they like. As always the 3 brother voted together to elect themselves to the board along with their spouses. Fifty thousand dollars of compensation for sitting on the board was also approved at the shareholders meeting with the brothers voting in favour and all other shareholders voting against. Compensation for sitting on a board is usual and the board had an independent compensation consultant's report to support the valuation. Still the minority shareholders are upset that their wishes were not being considered and believe that money should not be paid to both spouses. The directors want to know your opinion about their personal liability if any and what remedies might be pursued by the minority shareholders. (10 marks) 

	- sue: negligence & breach of fiduciary duty
		- director personal liability: **section 122a and 122b**
		- director: setting my own compensation, conflict of interest, breaks 122a
		- minority shareholders: derivative action, go to court and ask for permission to sue on behave of corporation
	- defence: relied on an expert(consultant) 
		- independent consultant report: due diligence rule
	- remedies:
		- oppression remedy
		- appraisal remedy

## Q&A
1. A partnership is not a separate legal identity but can sue people and be sued?
	- can be sued in it's name
2. Regarding the differences between limited partmership and limited liability partnership: "limited partnerships are not restricted to the professions" - what does this mean?
	- you can only be LLP if you are a certain profession
	- limited partnership does not have this
3. Negotiable instrument
	- cheque
4. Employment contract:
	- "I don't have the money to hire you anymore" -> temporary suspension -> "I will rehire you when I have work", then the employee is suplemented with EI
	- If you don't do this, you fire with a cause and need a notice
5. Partial fiduciary duties:
	- LLP: owe fiduciary duty like a lawyer, you owe fiduciary duty to your own clients
6. Express vs Actual vs Apparent
	- express does not mean writing only, actually stating it
7. Limited Liability Partnership vs corporations
	- issue: what are we trying to accomplish?
8. derivative action - shareholders sue officers/directors without the corporation
9. two duties:
	- fiduciary duty -> owed to the corporation alone
	- negligence obligation -> can be owed to anybody (shareholders, creditors, employees, etc.)
10. KitKat loses lawsuit in the EU
	- trademark
	- different across the world
11. Canada takes U.S. to NAFTA court over solar panel tariffs
	- sue the U.S. for hurting its profit
12. Facebook sued after its stock plunges
	- shareholder sues Facebook for using misleading user numbers, etc.
	- If this was in Canada, what law would apply?
		- tort: not negligent misrepresentation (he had the stock before and did not rely on the information Facebook said) since no reliance, but can sue because of the following
		- securities act: CEO and CFO should certify that your financial statements (that you give to your shareholders) are true
		- anybody affected by misleading the statement can sue the corporation/CEO/CFO/authorities that were involved in the preparation of the report, without proving reliance
		- this is a easier way to sue that negligent misrepresentation
