- Job description of officers
- Dividend process

### Raising Money

### Corporate Governance Defined
> A structure of standards by which business corporations are managed including the distribution of rights and responsibilities among different stakeholders. It is Through these standards that **company goals and obligations are met** and monitored.

- if not met, corporation will get shut down
- e.g. Enron Corp
	- avoid putting liability on the balance sheet
	- create a limited partnership with the lender (e.x. bank) -> silent investor -> keep the borrowing as an asset, so that the stock price will go up
	- CEO and CFO must sign financial statements and certify that they are true

### Internal Structure - Basic Corporate Governance
- Directors are not employees, but they hire the employees
- CEO runs the place and replace back

### Concepts in Modern Corporate Governance
- **Independence** (independent directors)
	- Eliminate conflict of interests in management
	- The independent director or committee, Chair & CEO
- **Transparency**
	- Internal controls - committee structure - role of the audit
	- whistleblowing
- **Timely Disclosure**
	- Mandatory reporting - shareholders, regulator, public
- **Accountability**
	- Criminal Sanctions
	- Regulatory Liability
	- Civil Liability to stakeholders
		- class action lawsuits by stakeholders

### Conrad Black's Control
- Conrad Black controls -> Revelstron Corp controls 78.2% of -> Hollinger Inc controls 72.6% of -> Holinger Intl which owns newspapers
- charged criminally with fraud

### Directors Personal Liability
- Negligence
- Statutory & Fiduciary Duty
- Strict Liability legislation - wages, texed, EI ...
- Section 122 of the CBCA describes the statutory duties of directors and officers:
	1. Every director and officer of a corporation in exercising their powers and discharging their duties shall
		1. act **honestly and in good faith** with a view to the best interests of the **corporation**) (not the shareholders); and
			- i.e. directors own a fiduciary duty to the corporation
		2. exercise the care, diligence and skill that a reasonably prudent person would exercise in comparable circumstances.
			- i.e. negligence
- Section 122 means that directors owe 2 duties
	1. fiduciary duty to the corporation
	2. anybody hurt by the mismanagement of the company as a result of the directors' negligence (creditors, employees who lost their jobs, consumers hurt by the products, shareholders, etc.) can sue, they don't have to rely on the corporation to sue

### Fiduciary Duty
- section 122(a) of CBCA
	- contracts with corporation - s.120
	- confidentiality
	- competing
	- use of information - insider trading
	- conflict of interest,
	- **Remedy - rescind the contracts plus...**
- section 122(b)
	- care, deligence and skill that a reasonably prudent person would exercise in comparable circumstances
	- creditors can sue under this, but not (a)
	- defence: business judgement rule
		- e.g. directors follow the process:
			1. investigate
			2. debate
			3. collect information
			4. debate
		- directors are personally liable for decisions that went wrong under a negligent process (e.g. skipped meetings, did not debate)
		- when the business goes bankrupt, they look for someone to blame, so directors look for a process that keeps them safe
	- reliance on an expert

### Conflict of Interest
- Directors and OFFICERS
- Obligations of Disclosure, do not vote, shareholder confirmation
- S.120 CBCA - how to handle a conflict
- Independence, *Transparency*
- Role of CEO, Chairman of the Board, director and shareholder
- Public Corporations vs. Private
- *Audit Committee, code of conduct*
- motivate professionals to act in a way that hurts their employees/clintes
	- e.x. doctors are paid more for some procedures than others
	- professors evaluated based on popularity among students -> likely to make the couse load easier and grades higher

### Intercepting an Opportunity
> e.g. you hear that your company wants to buy some land, and you buy it first at low price, then sell it to your company at a high price

- Outside opportunity
- Comes to you because you are a director
- Proposal for the company
- Not your shares
- Remedy - Civil Breach of Fiduciary Duty
- Remedy for the corporation CBCA

### Insider Trading
- Legislation - Securities Act / CBCA / OBCA - Private - Public, Criminal Code
- Use of insider information gained during work when dealing with shares of a public or even private corporation
- Insider - director, officer, employee, shareholder -+ tippee
- Disclosure Requirement
- Remedy - Civil, Criminal
	- company's brand, opportunities
	- not just a problem associated with damages
	- criminal liability
- Trading shares/information when you know something that others don't 
	- can happen to both private and public companies
	- can be both buy and sell
	- not necessarily your shares, may be other shares that are affected
	- do not have to be an insider, but as long as you get the inside information
	- stock tip is not a good thing
- Martha Stewart Example
	- the tippee; CEO (disclosed inside information and sold his own shares)
	- tippor (punished the tippor harder than the tippee)

### Penalty
- Criminal/Regulatory Liability - S.122 Securities Act
	- 5 Years &/or
	- Fine:
		- min = gain
		- max = 3x gain upto 5 million
	- Regulatory: Between civil and criminal
	- Insider trading is not just a public company's game
- Civil Liability for anyone's loss s.134 plus CBCA, account to company for profit
	- gives right to shareholders & the company to sue
	- public & private companies
- Criminal Code offence under s.382.1
	- 10 years
	- In Canada, very few people get 10 years, usually a fine
	- Canada:

### Strict Liability
> We don't care if they have dont anything wrong. Absence of fault -> still liable
