### Agency and Franchising
- both are ways to expand a business
- both invoke the assistance of others to reach wider market
- in both the principal/franchisor's business can be severely devalued by improper behaviour of the agent/franchisor
- however, **in agency** both principal and agent combine their efforts into one business
- **in franchising**, separate independent franchisee businesses are formed
	- very few are 100% franchisees, there are usually some corporate stores
	- various models:
		1. everybody franchisee deals with the parent (the franchisor)
		2. there are administrative franchisees (regional)

### Goal of Agency
- exception to the privity rule
- allow a third party to have **contractual rights** against the principal
- third party <--> principal <--> agent (agents speak for the principal)
- an absolutelegal necessity: you have to have agents to represent a corporation (to sign, act, etc. on behave of it)

### Why is a real estate agent not an example of a true agency relationship? (Correct answer: 3)
1. because the agent is paid by commission that fluctuates with the selling price
2. because he can act for both purchaser and vendor
3. **because the vendor accepts the offer to purchase himself** When defining agency, we have to determine whether the agent themselves have the right to form contracts
- In real estate, there is a conflict of interest on both sides:
	1. real estate agents are in a conflict of interest all the time: supposed to act in the interest of the buyer, but he earns the comission, so he actually wants the price to be high
	2. listing agents want people who do not have a real estate agent to win the offer, because then they do not have anyone to split the commission with

### Effect of Agency
- in a properly formed agency relationship, a contract is created between the principal and the thrid party and not between the agent and the third party even though they carried out the negotiations and accepted the offer
- show that you are the agent (disclose agency to third party)

### Creating an Agency Relationship
- express agreement - contract, rules of contract apply.
	- McDonald's sales agent has right to sell you the hamburger
	- but a listing agent does not have the right to sell you the house
	- problem -> limitation of agency: what happens when the agent exceeds their authority?
- ratification - beyond the agent's powers but subsequently approved
	- must have capacity
	- must not make conditional (no asking, cannot say "let me ask my boss on Tuesday")
	- must disclose agency to third party
- estopel / holding out (what if the boss says no?)
	- doctrine of apparent authority (misrepresenting yourself). should the thrid party have known? (is it reasonable that the third party had no reason to suspect that you do not have authority)
- necessity - all but gone
	- agency buying necessity (emergency): not very reliable 
	- s. 45 of the Family Law Act (even rarer): spouse has to pay for the other spouse

### Duties of an Agent to a Principle
- fiduciary relationship
	- obedience and diligence: devote your time and attention
	- competence: negligence still applies, no subbing the agents out
	- personal performance: agent must perform
	- good faith

### Duties of a Principal to an Agent
- no fiduciary
- pay him!

### Liability under Contract
- contract is created between Principal and third party. Agent has no contractual liability to third party
- no mention of agency to third party and one really exists - third party gets the choice
- shows agency but there isn't one - no contractual rights at all (misrepresentation / deceit -> tort)

### Liability under Tort
- shows egency but there isn't one - agent is liable - new tort
	- **breach of warranty of authority**
- any misrepresentation made by an agent in the course of creating a contract attract liability for agent and principal

### Termination of the Agency Relationship
- contract calls for its own dissolution
- performance
- death
- bankruptcy
- loss of capacity

### Franchising
- franchisor puts together the intellectual property, confidential information and know how of a business and licenses the franchisee to use it 
	- all these packaged in the product
	- sold to an independent business
- creates an independent business separate from that of the franchisor
- key to success is control and consistency: location, quality, visual appearance and service
	- franchisees must operate under the same intensity/standards
	- otherwise: individual business loses customers, franchisor also looses (other) franchisees
- uses contract law, consumer protection legislation, intellectual propety law (new!) and tort law
	- intellectual property law: so that the franchisor protects their intellectual property law when using and sharing
	- e.x. Tim Hortons: roll up the rim (patented), how the coffee is brewed (patented), what my cups look like, etc. (branding) -> intellectual property

### What is Intellectual Property?
- branding and "know how"
- copyright (example song in Tim Horton's ad), 50 years
- trademark (example logo): (ex. works of art) 
	- must be **exclusively associated** with your product
	- e.x. "Harvey makes a hamburger beautiful"
	- defend your trademark (sue everyone that uses your trademark), can last indefinitely
- patents (example coffee recipe)

### Franchise Agreement
- standard form contract designed by the franchisor (one-sided, in the franchisor's interest)
- contractual - utmost good faith (once you are in it, you must behave honestly to the other party: cannot lie, cannot cheat)
	- less than fiduciary but more than normal
	- must act:
		1. honestly
		2. reasonably
		3. fairly in the negotiation and performace of the contract
		4. to **enhance** and **protect the value** of the brand
	- legislation
		- Arthur Wishart Act - Financial Disclosure
		- Utmost Good Faith s.3
		- Right to Associate s.4 
			- protects the right to associate with other franchisees
			- i.e. has the right to talk to other franchisees
			- e.x. franchisees can negotiate together, find out the price that other franchisees are getting from the franchisor, etc.
			- **protects the franchisees** from a very one-sided contract
			- this is sorta like the consumer protection legislation
		- Franchisor Disclosure Document s.5
			1. 14 days before signing agreement
			2. right to rescind
			3. damages for misrepresentation (e.x. if a Timmie's branch is asked to renovate again, this is what they will rely on, not to rescind)
			4. also Alberta
			5. **Purose is (also) to protect the franchisee**
- license to use/operate for a term
- agreement to supply, exclusive
- national advertising and promotion
- adherence to process, training (otherwise: devalues the franchisor and other franchisees)
- confidentiality clauses
- non-competition clauses
- restricted area
- franchise free + % - plus renovation costs
- access, disclosure and supervision

### Liability to Public
- Separate liability
- No agency or vicarious liability
- Use Tort Causes of Action against Franchisor
