### Performance
- A contract comes to an end when all promises have been performed
- If both sides have received everything they are entitled to we say the contract is discharged
- If has no further legal effect - discharged
- If not everything was received then there has been a breach
- **Breach of contract** cause of action

### Types of Breach
- Express repudiation (rejection)
  - it is a statement, no conduct required. "I'm not paying you"
  - anticipatory breach (ahead of time)
    1. gives the plaintiff the opportunity to mediate their loss (e.x. find someone else to do it for them)
    2. this will be considered in court
    3. the breaching party can save money and negative inference from the court
    4. this can be rejected
  - at time of performance
- Conduct rendering performance impossible (self-induced frustration)
  - e.x. cottage burned down after the contract was signed
- Failure to Perform
  - usually apprent only at the time set for performance
  - Complete
  - Partial: how much is enough? is this a big deal?
    - e.x. What if out of the 500 TVs that I am expecting, only 450 showed up? Should I still pay?

### Seriousness of the Breach (a matter of how many TVs is enough)
- Breach:
  1. Material - discharge and damages (you don't have to do your part)
  2. Minor - damages only
    - doctrine of substantial performance: performace that does not comply in some minor way with the requirements of the contract
- The test is substantial performance: the assessment is whether you still have to do your part
- Mistakes in performamce:
  - **quasi-contract**: an obligation that may arise, not as a result of contractual relations, but because one party has received an unfair benefit at the expense of the other

### Exemption of Liability
- Exemption Clauses seek to protect the party from lawsuits to enforce a contract
- **Fundamental Breach** is a principle that a court may use to enforce the rights under a contract despite the presence of an exmption clause
  - This makes "I am not liable for breach of contract" impossible
  - The above statement makes no sense since it's the whole point of a contract
  - However, you can have statements such as "I am not liable for consequences of late delivery, etc."

### Deciding to Enforce an Exemption Clause (3 steps)
1. Interpretation
  - Does this situation fall into the wording
2. Unconcsionable
  - Is the powerful party taking an unfair advantage of the weaker one
  - So unfair that it is unacceptable
3. Public Policy and Public Interest
  - Should public good override the freedom to contract
  - E.x. Look at the whole industry: can auditors exempt themselves from their liability?
  - It makes no sense to have contract law if you can just add an exmemption clause to get you out of the whole contract

### Remedies
- What can I get?
- What will the court give me?

### Damages
- Money
- Not to punish
- Primary remedy in contract
- Different calculation than in tort-categories and time
  1. Tort - how much worse off am I? (loss)
  2. Contract - how much better I would have been?
- Duty to mitigate
  - Gotta do whatchu gotta do to **reduce the loss**
- Liquidated damage clauses
- Prerequisites:
    1. loss must flow from the breach
      - within foreseeable limits of what the parties would have expected as a likely consequence of a failure to perform
      - not awarded to compensate unusual/unexpected consequence of breach
    2. damages must be mitigated
      - party that suffered a loss must do what it can to minimize losses
      - mitigation - similar in tort
      - injured party cannot receive damage for loss that could be prevented

### Common Law Damages (these will add up to the total amount)
- Expectation damages - profit
  - Expectation damages = (Expected position of the plaintiff if the contract had been performed) – (The actual position the plaintiff is in after the breach of contract)
- Opportunity cost - what else I could have done
  - lost opportunity cost: the lost chance of making a similar cotract with a different promisor
- Consequential damages - people who will now sue me
  - secondary losses incurred by the nonbreaching party that were foreseeable at the time of contracting, chain effect
- General damages - non economic losses
  - e.g. professional entertainer's face got ruined by a plastic surgery -> general damages
- Specific damages - expenses - mitigation or performance
- Reliance damages - preparation costs
  - costs of expenditures and wasted effort reasonably made in preparation for performance
- Punitive Damages
  - for malicious or bad faith behaviour of the breaching party
  - e.g.  
- Liquidated damages - fixed amount ahead (agreed by both parties in the conntract)
  - penalty clause
- Nominal damages - token (court award of $1)
- Mental anguish (compensation for mental distress)
  1. Wrongful Dismissal: Usually not compensable, but when employers lie about the reason for dismissal or defaming the reputation of the employee, mental anguish is awarded
  2. Lost holidays

### Equitable Remedies
- Prerequisites:
  1. plaintiff must come to court with "clean hands"
  2. plaintiff must not delay in bringing an action
  3. refuse equitable remedy if it would affect an innocent purchasor
  4. plaintiff must have paid meaningful consideration for the defendant's promise
  5. plaintiff must ordinarily be a party whom the remedy would be awarded were he the defendant instead (or damage not enough)
- Specific Performance
  - I dont want money, I just want the house (money is not enough)
  - do a contracted-for act, usually to complete a transaction
- Injunction
  - Make them stop doing something
  - e.x. prohibit them from selling to the U.S.
- Mandamus
  - Make them do something that's not in the contract
  - Usually something positive
  - e.x. apologize
- Declaration
  - If they do this again, let them know what they should do
- Rescission
  - Unmaking of the contract between parties
- Quantum meruit
  - the fair amount a person deserves to be paid for benefit conferred
  - non-breaching party partially did their part

### Enforcement of Judgement
- Collection
  - Garnishment
    - creditor: garnishee order against a debtor’s wages
  - Executions
    - an execution order gives the sheriff authority to seize and sell various goods and arrange for a sale of the debtor’s lands after an appropriate grace period
  - Judgement Debtor Examinations
    - a person can be put in jail if they lie in court / don't show up to court
    - can't be arrested for not having enough money to pay the debt
  - Contempt of court: may be punished by imprisonment
