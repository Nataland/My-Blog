#### Performance
- A contract comes to an end when all promises have been performed
- If both sides have received everything they are entitled to we say the contract is discharged
- If has no further legal effect - discharged
- If not everything was received then there has been a breach
- **Breach of contract** cause of action

#### Types of Breach
- Express repudiation (rejection)
  - it is a statement, no conduct required. "I'm not paying you"
  - anticipatory breach (ahead of time)
    1. gives the plaintiff the opportunity to mediate their loss (e.x. find someone else to do it for them)
    2. this will be considered in court
    3. the breaching party can save money and negative inference from the court
    4. this can be rejected
  - at time of performance
- Conduct rendering performance impossible (self-induced frustration)
  - e.x. cottage burned down after the contract was signed
- Failure to Perform
  - Complete
  - Partial: how much is enough? is this a big deal?
    - e.x. What if out of the 500 TVs that I am expecting, only 450 showed up? Should I still pay?

#### Seriousness of the Breach (a matter of how many TVs is enough)
- Breach:
  1. Material - discharge and damages (you don't have to do your part)
  2. Minor - damages only
- The test is substantial performance: the assessment is whether you still have to do your part

#### Exemption of Liability
- Exemption Clauses seek to protect the party from lawsuits to enforce a contract
- **Fundamental Breach** is a principle that a court may use to enforce the rights under a contract despite the presence of an exmption clause
  - This makes "I am not liable for breach of contract" impossible
  - The above statement makes no sense since it's the whole point of a contract
  - However, you can have statements such as "I am not liable for consequences of late delivery, etc."

#### Deciding to Enforce an Exemption Clause (3 steps)
1. Interpretation
  - Does this situation fall into the wording
2. Unconcsionable
  - Is the powerful party taking an unfair advantage of the weaker one
  - So unfair that it is unacceptable
3. Public Policy and Public Interest
  - Should public good override the freedom to contract
  - E.x. Look at the whole industry: can auditors exempt themselves from their liability?
  - It makes no sense to have contract law if you can just add an exmemption clause to get you out of the whole contract

### Remedies
- What can I get?
- What will the court give me?

#### Damages
- Money
- Primary remedy in contract
- Different calculation than in tort-categories and time
  1. Tort - how much worse off am I? (loss)
  2. Contract - how much better I would have been?
- Duty to mitigate
  - Gotta do whatchu gotta do to **reduce the loss**
- Liquidated damage clauses

#### Common Law Damages (these will add up to the total amount)
- Expectation damages - profit
- Opportunity cost - what else I could have done
- Consequential damages - people who will now sue me
- General damages - non economic losses
- Specific damages - expenses - mitigation or performance
- Reliance damages - preparation costs
- Liquidated damages - fixed amount ahead
- Nominal damages - token

#### Equitable Remedies
- Specific Performance
  - I dont want money, I just want to house
- Injunction
  - Make them stop doing something
  - e.x. prohibit them from selling to the U.S.
- Mandamus
  - Make them do something that's not in the contract
  - Usually something positive
  - e.x. apologize
- Declaration
  - If they do this again, let them know what they should do
- Rescission
  - Unmaking of the contract between parties

#### Enforcement of Judgement
- Collection
  - Garnishment
  - Executions
  - Judgement Debtor Examinations
    - a person can be put in jail if they lie in court / don't show up to court
    - can't be arrested for not having enough money to pay the debt
  - Contempt
