```
Midterm:
- Define the law before giving the facts.
- Bill is responsible for negligent misrepresentation, not negligence.
```

### Bailment
- Exists as a combination of Tort and Contract
- "Look after my stuff for me"
	- Borrowing or lending
	- Transfer of possession of goods to someone other than the owner, without transfer of ownership
	- The owner has allowed someone else to hold it
	- e.x. dry cleaning, borrowing a book from the library
	- What is the liability of the person that has the item?
- Varying standard of care (different levels)
	- How careful you should be depends on the situation:
	1. Gratuitous bailment for benefit of bailee (highest level of care)
		- Borrowing your neighbour's lawn mower to mow your lawn
	2. Bailment for value - contractual
		- Commercial, industry standard
	3. Gratuitous Bailment for the benefit of bailor (lowest level of care)
		- The bailor is the owner
		- Asks your neighbour to look after your dog
	- Case 1: two-year-old Scotch (dog) died when he was put in a drying cage after being groomed
		- Loss piece of property
		- Emotional loss associated with loss of dog ($1000 dog for trauma)
	- Case 2: 
		- No $54 Million for missing pants, judge rules
		- Judge who lost Pant suit for loses job
	- Case 3: Storage of trumpet
		- Gratuitous Bailment for benefit of bailor
		- The school is doing the owner(student) a favour by letting him leave the trumpet at school and not having to carry it home
		- Second best answer: bailment for value (the school may receive value from having a quality trumpet)

### Proving What Went Wrong
- Who is in the best position to know?
- Bailor proves:
	1. Gave it to Bailee in good condition, and
	2. Got it back in bad condition (or did not get it back at all)
- To avoid liability Bailee must show:
	- Met the applicable standard of care

### Special Bailments
- Storage and Safekeeping
	- Warehousing
	- High standard - no subs
	- Contract with exemption clauses 
	- Liens
	- What if they never come back to get it? I want to have the right to remove it
	- The get to keep the item until the bailor pays
- Repair
	- Repair and Storage Liens Act
	- The fact that you don't leave the store does not change that it is a bailment
- Transportation - varying standard of care according to type of transporters
	1. Gratuitous carriers
		- Let my friend carry it
		- Lowest level of liability
	2. Private carriers
		- Very specific, with special equipments
		- e.x. piano movers
		- In their genre, it's a high level of care
		- No full exposure
	3. Common carriers (highest level of liability), (completely) strictly liable
		- take all kinds of products -> common
		- three defences:
		1. Act of god (ice storms, tornadoes, etc.)
		2. Inherent defect (the carrier got the item like that)
		2. Default of shipper: "the shipper packed it wrong"
- Hotels and Innkeepers 
	- Disappearance vs. Damage
		- The only stuff you bail to the hotel/inn is stuff in the safe
		- The hotel is telling you that the safe is the safest place
	- Innkeepers Act.

### Remedies
- Damages = cost of service or cost of repair or replacement
- Lien - Repair and Storage Liens Act
	- Possession must be retained or lost
	- Problem: cost to repair exceeded the value of item
- Sale - Repair and Storage Liens Act
	- Reasonable price 
	- Liability if sold too cheap
		- Fair maket value price?
		- Leave the bid open for long enough?
	- Sale price - cost of sale - bill & interest
