## LO2
### Strategic HR management (5 steps)

1. Organizational mission, goals and strategy analysis

   - **mission statement** specifies what activities the organization intends to pursue and what course is charted for the future
     - who we are
     - what we do
     - where we are headed
   - **major strategies**
     - **cost leadership strategy**
       - gain a competitive advantage through lower costs
       - tight controls on costs
       - e.g. the Bic Pen Company (producing pens as cheaply as possible)
     - **differentiation strategy**
       - creating a distinctive or even unique product that is unsurpassed in quality, innovative design, or other features
       - i.e. product design/unique technology/carefully planned advertising and promotion/etc.
       - e.g. Nikon cameras and Calvin Klein
     - **focus strategy**
       - concentrates on a segment of the market and attempts to satisfy it with a low-priced or a highly distinctive product
       - can be based on differentiation/cost leadership strategy
       - target market: geographically/different special needs
       - e.g. firm sells sport utility vehicles in NA and sells smaller cars in less-developed countries

2. Environmental scan

   - economic
     - economic cycles/business cycles
     - recession: planning, communicating and implementing employee layoffs; supplementary employee counselling
     - growth: recruit employees with a different skill set than those that may have been let go during the recessionary cycle
     - global trade:
       - exports more than US/Japan
       - 2011: 12th most competitive; 2015: fallen to 15th
     - productivity: outputs/imputs
       - high productivity -> improved profits
       - higher quality of work life for imployees -> improvements in productivity
       - worrisome: gap in the productivity levels of Canada vs US
       - to improve competitiveness and innovation, need people management and technology
   - technological
     - flexible work design
       - works better in firms with nonroutine production precesses (not a factory, but for software developers)
       - influences organizations and the way people work
       - can change the entire industry: e.g. Kodak
       - Canada: rapid growth, but lags behind a number of developed nations in technology development and use
       - **telecommuting**
         - cut employee stress
         - boost worker productivity
         - reduce the cost of operations

       - challenges: negative union attitudes; require highly skilled designers, operators and technicians
   - demographic
     - gender balance in the workforce
       - education levels, age levels, % of the population participating in the workforce, etc.
       - over 78% total labour force is employed in service-producing industries
       - demographic changes (slow, has influence)
     - **knowledge workers**
       - because of a shift from employment in primary and extractive industries to serve, technical, and professional jobs
       -  fastest-growing type of workers
       - challenge: employees hiding and withholding knowledge and educational attainment is not keeping pace
     - **educational attainment**
       - upward trend
       - supply of skills needed by the post-industrial society
       - disturbing news: 15% Canadians over 16 have low literacy: main contributor to safety violations and accidents
       - the demand for individuals with post-secondary education will outpace the rate at which people attain a post-secondary education 
       - employability skills (foundation skills): basic academic skills, personal management skills, and teamwork skills
     - aging population
       - hr challenge: more people leaving the workforce than entering it
       - increasingly hectic scramble for jobs: fear of post-retirement poverty, motivate employees to hold on to their current jobs

     2. determine uses of job analysis information
        - common in recruitment process, designing performance appraisal, compensation systems, and training
        - ensure fair treatment
        - assist job redesign

        - job holder, human and nonhuman
        - published materials
     5. data collection instrument design
        - **job analysis questionnaires**:
          - **identification**: job title, division, title of supervisors, job identification number (optional)
          - **duties and responsibilities**: purpose, what it accomplishes, how it's performed

          - Position analysis questionnaire (PAQ): more quantitative and finely tuned
          - Critical incident method (CIM): describing specific events/incidents
     6. choice of method for data collection

     | method             | description                                                  | pros                                                         | cons                                                         |
     | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
     | **interviews**     | uses job analysis questionnaire as a guide; interviews both jobholders and supervisors | high level of accuracy and validity                          | slow and expensive                                           |
     | **focus groups**   | 5-7 jobholders interactively discuss the job's duties and responsibilities | gain consensus on job duties; ideas building off of each other | if supervisor in the focus group as well, may not share as much |
     | **questionnaires** | through electronic/internal mail/Canada Post                 | less accurate: misunderstood questions, incomplete responses, low response rates | studies many jobs at little cost                             |
     | **employee log**   | in which workers periodically summarize their tasks and activities | accurate if made over entire job cycle                       | time consuming and costly, seen as a nuisance                |
     | **observation**    | direct observation                                           | able to confirm/remove doubts, removes language barriers     | slow, costly, less accurate                                  |
     | **combinations**   | a combination of two or more techniques concurrently         | overcomes shortcomings of each method                        |                                                              |

    - additional cost
    - inappropriate recruits often leave the organization -> additional costs to hire and train replacements

## LO 2

### Constraints on recruitment

- organizational policies
  1. promote-from-within policies
     - give present employees the first opportunity for job openings and favilitate their career growth
     - widespread
     - significant impact: ad in newspaper or posted in lunchroom
     - bypassing current employees -> employee dissatisfaction and turnover
     - positive organizational culture -> encourages people to join and stay
  2. compensation policies
     - pay policies
     - pay ranges for different jobs
  3. employment status policies
     - e.g. policies restricting the hire of part-time/temporary employees
  4. international hiring policies
     - require foreign job openings to be staffed with local citizens
     - foreign nationals: reduce relocation expenses, lessen the likelihood of nationalization, minimize charges of economic exploitation

  - outlines which jobs should be filled by recruiting/internally
  - summarizes future recruiting needs
- diversity management plans
  - cannot discriminate
  - proactive employers use innovative recruitment programs

     - variations -> inaccurate plans
  3. employment statistics
     - Statistics Canada: the state of employment in different industry sectors
- job requirements
  - highly specialized workers are more difficult to find than unskileld ones
  - job analysis information is useful
  - *“Find the best and most experienced applicant you can”*  
- costs
  - operate within budgets
  - careful hr pl;anning and forethough by recruiters to minimize expenses
  - recruiting for several job openings simultanerously
  - reduce employee turnover
- inducements
  - may be necessary to stimulate a potential recruit's interest
  - can be non-menetary/intangible
  - e.g. flextime, high quality of life, other initiatives

### Applying for a job

## LO 5

### Evaluating the recruitment function

- expensive: possible that benefit < cost
- evaluating effectiveness of recruiting strategies

| method                    | description                                                  | pros                                    | cons                                                         |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| cost per hire             | doller/person hired, including direct costs and approtioned costs and overheads |                                         | somtimes not collected, and ignores the quality of the people hired |
| quality of hires and cost | the number and quality of résumés and job applications received | indication of the overall effectiveness | better quality resumes may not be translated finally to offers |
| offers-applicants ratio   | the ratio between the number of job offers extended and the total number of applicants | can point out weaknesses                | acceptance is dependent on extraneous variables              |
| time lapsed per hire      | the number of days, weeks, or months taken to fill a position | shorter -> more efficient               | several external and uncontrollable factors, should be used in conjunction |

# Chapter 6

- selection begins with a pool of suitable applicants created through recruiting
- the selection process: a series of specific steps used to decide which recruits should be hired 

## LO 1 - LO 5

- Successful Execution of an Organization’s Strategy Depends on the Calibre of Its Employees
  - quality and calibre or employees -> effectiveness and success of organization
- An Organization’s Selection Decisions Must Reflect Job Requirements
  - mismatch -> poor hires, lawsuits
- Selection Strategy Must Be Well Integrated with Organizational Priorities 
  - organizational characteristics
- Selection Strategy Must Recognize Organizational Constraints
  - finite resources, need cost-effective systems
  - limits: budgets and policies
- Selection Strategy Must Adapt to Labour Market Realities 
  - **selection ratio**: number of applicants hired/total number of applicants available

## LO 2

### The selection process

1. **preliminary reception of applicants**
   - initial contact
   - preliminary interview for obvious misfits 
2. **applicant screening**
   - the organization will have received a number of résumés or completed job application forms 
   - resumes and job application forms
   - **weighted application blank (WAB)**: some aspects are more related to job success, applicants evaluated for total success score
   - **biographical information blanks (BIBs)**: biodata, personal history and life experiences
     - items must not adversely affect any protected groups of Canadians, must be job-related
     - may be viewed as invasive, turn off qualified applicants
     - results not easily verifiable
     - developed by the organization
   - concern: resume fraud
3. **administration of employment tests**
   - devices that assess the match between applicants and job requirements 
   - written tests/exercises that simulate work conditions
   - **reliability and validity of selection tests**
     - reliability: tests yields consistent results
     - validity: is the test accurately measuring what it is purported to measure?
     - **differential validity**: valid for a large group, but not for subgroups of minorities or women
     - **validity generalization**: applying validity results amassed from many individual validity studies to guide test choices for a current organization and job
     - **local validation studies**: HR conduct own studies
   - types of tests
     - personality tests
       - measure personality or temperament
       - stable traits
       - designed with psychologically normal, working people in mind
       - big 5 personality factors: conscientiousness, agreeableness, neuroticism/emotional stability, openness to experience, and extraversion
       - linked to ratings of job performance, training performance, absenteeism, and counterproductive work behaviours  
     - ability tests
       - predict which job applicants have the skills, knowledge. and ability to do the job
       - cognitive ability tests: assess memory, reasoning, and verbal and mathematical abilities 
     - knowledge tests
       - measure a person's information or knowledge about job requirements
       - e.g. coding challenge for software engineers
     - performance tests
       - work samples
       - measures the ability of applicants to do some parts of the work for which they are to be hired
       - **situational judgement test**: hypothetical job scenarios, behavioural response
       - **computer-interactive performance tests**: react to a simulation, mental and motor are assessed with high reliability
     - integrity tests
       - honesty tests
       - measures honesty and trustworthiness
       - **overt tests**: direct questions about past thefts
       - **non-overt tests**: respond to questions about their risk-taking behaviours and attitudes toward dishonest behaviours
       - important items may not be testable
4. **employment interview(s)**
   - (immediate) **supervisors**
   - hr: provide supervisor with best applicants available
   - supervisor: decide from above
   - interviewed by several persons (consecutively/panel interview)
5. **realistic job previews**
   - supplement to the supervisory interview
   - allows the potential employee to understand the job setting before the hiring decision is made
   - unmet expectations about a job contribute to initial job dissatisfaction 
   - lower turnover, improve performance, increase job satisfaction, and generate greater trust of the organization
   - adverse effect: more candidates declining job offers when working conditions do not appear appealing
6. **verification of references**
   - personal references - friends or family
   - **employment refereces**: discuss applicant's work history, confirmation of prior employment
   - **reference letters**
     - lack of candour
     - often omitted
   - specialized agencies to conduct background checks
   - use social networking website such as Facebook to learn more about the applicant's interested and behaviours
   - legal obligations
7. **contingent assessments**
   - before the job offer is made
   - e.g. a **medical evaluation**, need to be job related to avoid possible allegations of discrimination
   - **drug tests**
     - assure the absence of steroids and stimulants
     - increases in mortality rates, accidents, theft, and poor performance affect the employer’s economic performance 
     - negative consequences for customers/fellow employees
     - discrimination: drug-dependence = disability
     - employers cannot automatically withdraw offers of employment from candidates who fail alcohol or drug tests without offering accommodation 
8. **hiring decision**
   - single predictor used: easy to determine
   - multiple predictors used: more complex
   - tradeoffs among predictors
     - subjective approach
       - clinical approach
       - subjectively evaluates
       - different decision made by different decision makers - "gut feeling"
     - multiple cut-off approach
       - cut-off scores for each predictor and each applicant evaluated on a pass-fail basis
       - approach is easy to understand
       - deficiency in one predictor cannot be compensated by supeiror performance in another
       - may reject qualified applicants -> poor public relations and possible legal challenges
     - compensatory approach
       - a higher score on a predictor may compensate for a low score on another 
       - add all predictors and look at the total score, take the highest
       - **multiple hurdles approach**: need to pass a predictor satisfactorily before the next one, useful when predictors are expensive (put them later in the process)

### After Selection

- specify probationary period if applicable
- specify start date and terms of employment clearly
- specify reasonable restrictive covenants: confidentiality, noncompete clauses
- ensure that termination procedures are legally enforceable

### Dispositioning of applicants

- applicants whom the organization no longer wishes to pursue
- communicate ASAP
- wording of rejection letter
- consider for other openings
- treat new hires with respect and consideration

## LO 6

    - all interviewers meet with an applicant at the same time
    - improved reliability
  - unstructured interview
    - develop questions as the interview proceeds
    - friendly conversation
    - lacks reliability
  - structured interview
    - predetermined set of questions
    - same questions for all applicants
    - reliable, but does not allow followups
    - situational and behavioural description interviews
  - **behavioural description interviews**
    - how job applicants respionded to specific work situations in the past
    - "*tell me about a time where you ...*"
    - choose *typical situations*
  - **situational interview**
    - assess a job applicant’s likely future response to specific situations 
    - real events that describe either effective or ineffective work behaviour
