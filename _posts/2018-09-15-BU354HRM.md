# Chapter 1 Strategic Human resource Management


## LO1
- **organization goals**: economic, social, environmental
- **human resource management**
  - inseparable from key organizational goals, product-market plans, technology and innovation, and an organization's strategy
  - activities: diversity, compensation and benefits, hr planning. recruitment & selection, training and development, performance appraisal, labour relations, employee relations, legal compliance, job analysis and safety

- **proactive human resource management**: make adjustments before challenges/problems impact the organization or its people
- **reatice human resource management**: respond to problems or challenges as they arise

## LO2
### Strategic HR management (5 steps)

1. Organizational mission, goals and strategy analysis

   - **mission statement** specifies what activities the organization intends to pursue and what course is charted for the future
     - who we are
     - what we do
     - where we are headed
   - **major strategies**
     - **cost leadership strategy**
       - gain a competitive advantage through lower costs
       - tight controls on costs
       - e.g. the Bic Pen Company (producing pens as cheaply as possible)
     - **differentiation strategy**
       - creating a distinctive or even unique product that is unsurpassed in quality, innovative design, or other features
       - i.e. product design/unique technology/carefully planned advertising and promotion/etc.
       - e.g. Nikon cameras and Calvin Klein
     - **focus strategy**
       - concentrates on a segment of the market and attempts to satisfy it with a low-priced or a highly distinctive product
       - can be based on differentiation/cost leadership strategy
       - target market: geographically/different special needs
       - e.g. firm sells sport utility vehicles in NA and sells smaller cars in less-developed countries

2. Environmental scan

   - economic
     - economic cycles/business cycles
     - recession: planning, communicating and implementing employee layoffs; supplementary employee counselling
     - growth: recruit employees with a different skill set than those that may have been let go during the recessionary cycle
     - global trade:
       - exports more than US/Japan
       - 2011: 12th most competitive; 2015: fallen to 15th
     - productivity: outputs/imputs
       - high productivity -> improved profits
       - higher quality of work life for imployees -> improvements in productivity
       - worrisome: gap in the productivity levels of Canada vs US
       - to improve competitiveness and innovation, need people management and technology

   - technological
     - flexible work design
       - works better in firms with nonroutine production precesses (not a factory, but for software developers)
       - influences organizations and the way people work
       - can change the entire industry: e.g. Kodak
       - Canada: rapid growth, but lags behind a number of developed nations in technology development and use
       - **telecommuting**
         - cut employee stress
         - boost worker productivity
         - reduce the cost of operations

         - used in HR
         - requires HR policies
     - mechanization
       - human work -> machine work
       - speed, reliability, flexibility (able to produce in small batches)
       - increased predictability and reliability (no strikes) in operations and higher standards of quality in production
       - challenges: negative union attitudes; require highly skilled designers, operators and technicians

   - demographic
     - gender balance in the workforce
       - education levels, age levels, % of the population participating in the workforce, etc.
       - over 78% total labour force is employed in service-producing industries
       - demographic changes (slow, has influence)
     - **knowledge workers**
       - because of a shift from employment in primary and extractive industries to serve, technical, and professional jobs
       -  fastest-growing type of workers
       - challenge: employees hiding and withholding knowledge and educational attainment is not keeping pace
     - **educational attainment**
       - upward trend
       - supply of skills needed by the post-industrial society
       - disturbing news: 15% Canadians over 16 have low literacy: main contributor to safety violations and accidents
       - the demand for individuals with post-secondary education will outpace the rate at which people attain a post-secondary education 
       - employability skills (foundation skills): basic academic skills, personal management skills, and teamwork skills
     - aging population
       - hr challenge: more people leaving the workforce than entering it
       - increasingly hectic scramble for jobs: fear of post-retirement poverty, motivate employees to hold on to their current jobs
       - aging population affects many hr functions: recruitment and selection, job design, training, appraisal, and compensation and benefits administration 
       - preassure for expanded retirement benefits, variable work schedules, coordination of government benefits with company benefits, and retaining programs
       - Canada: declining youth population vs India
     - **generational shift**
       - Traditionalists (1922 - 1945)

         - not averse to hard work
         - work-life balance
         - decision-making
         - dislike "command and control" culture
         - more loyalty to profession vs employers
       - Gen Y (1977 - 1995)
         - newest generation in the labour market
         - continuous learning, ongoing feedback, teamwork, up-to-date technology, security, respect, and work-life balance
         - biggest fear: boredom
         - may have unrealistically high expectations, targets, resultant frustration

   - cultural
     - diversity
       - **cultural mosaic** (not melting pot): coexistence of numerous national, racial, and ethnic groups, each with its unique cultural and social background
       - HR's responsibility to maximize the beneficial outcomes and minimize the challenges posed by a diverse workforce
     - ethics
       - greater demand for ethical conduct

       - unethical practices: creative accounting, insider trading, securities fraud, excessive payments made to top management not reflective of their contributions, and bribery and kickbacks

       - examples: Bre-X, Enron, and WorldCom

       - Canadian firms: code of ethics or code of conduct

       - What Is a “Right” Behaviour?

         | Universalist approach     | Persons who embrace this view assert that some moral standards are universally applicable. In other words, regardless of society or place, a bad act (such as killing or stealing) is bad. There are no exceptions to moral “rights” and “wrongs.” |
         | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
         | **Situational approach**  | **What is good or bad depends essentially on the situation or culture surrounding the actor. While telling the truth is desirable, there may be situations in which lying is acceptable or even necessary, or other cultures may not value truth to the same extent. Similarly, while killing is bad, there may be situations in which this act is justified. It all depends on the situation. While high morals are to be followed, an individual may have to make exceptions when outcomes justify them.** |
         | **Subjectivist approach** | **Subjectivist approach: In this approach, the individual decision maker facing a situation determines what is right and wrong after considering all aspects of the situation. Moral decisions are based on personal values and preferences. Needless to say, the standards imposed by individuals are vastly different depending on their upbringing, current circumstances, values, and beliefs.** |

- HR: formalize the collection, evaluation, and organization of this information

## LO 2

- threes phases of job analysis:
  1. preparation for job analysis
     1. familiarization with the organization and its jobs
        - objectives, strategies, structure, inputs, and desired outcomes
     2. determine uses of job analysis information
        - common in recruitment process, designing performance appraisal, compensation systems, and training
        - ensure fair treatment
        - assist job redesign
     3. identify jobs to be analyzed
        - jobs that are critical to the success of an organization: difficult to learn/perform, ones that continuously hires new employees/ones that exclude members of the protected classes
        - for new techlogy or altered work environments
  2. collection of job analysis information
     4. determine sources of job data
        - job holder, human and nonhuman
        - published materials
     5. data collection instrument design
        - **job analysis questionnaires**:
          - **identification**: job title, division, title of supervisors, job identification number (optional)
          - **duties and responsibilities**: purpose, what it accomplishes, how it's performed
          - **human characteristics and working conditions**: skills, abilities, training, education, experience, etc. needed by jobholders

          - Position analysis questionnaire (PAQ): more quantitative and finely tuned
          - Critical incident method (CIM): describing specific events/incidents
     6. choice of method for data collection

     | method             | description                                                  | pros                                                         | cons                                                         |
     | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
     | **interviews**     | uses job analysis questionnaire as a guide; interviews both jobholders and supervisors | high level of accuracy and validity                          | slow and expensive                                           |
     | **focus groups**   | 5-7 jobholders interactively discuss the job's duties and responsibilities | gain consensus on job duties; ideas building off of each other | if supervisor in the focus group as well, may not share as much |
     | **questionnaires** | through electronic/internal mail/Canada Post                 | less accurate: misunderstood questions, incomplete responses, low response rates | studies many jobs at little cost                             |
     | **employee log**   | in which workers periodically summarize their tasks and activities | accurate if made over entire job cycle                       | time consuming and costly, seen as a nuisance                |
     | **observation**    | direct observation                                           | able to confirm/remove doubts, removes language barriers     | slow, costly, less accurate                                  |

     - give present employees the first opportunity for job openings and favilitate their career growth
     - widespread
     - significant impact: ad in newspaper or posted in lunchroom
     - bypassing current employees -> employee dissatisfaction and turnover
     - positive organizational culture -> encourages people to join and stay
  2. compensation policies
     - pay policies
     - pay ranges for different jobs
  3. employment status policies
     - e.g. policies restricting the hire of part-time/temporary employees
  4. international hiring policies
     - require foreign job openings to be staffed with local citizens
     - foreign nationals: reduce relocation expenses, lessen the likelihood of nationalization, minimize charges of economic exploitation
- human resource plans
  - another factor
  - outlines which jobs should be filled by recruiting/internally
  - summarizes future recruiting needs
- diversity management plans
  - cannot discriminate
  - proactive employers use innovative recruitment programs

### Evaluating the recruitment function

- expensive: possible that benefit < cost
- evaluating effectiveness of recruiting strategies

| method                    | description                                                  | pros                                    | cons                                                         |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| cost per hire             | doller/person hired, including direct costs and approtioned costs and overheads |                                         | somtimes not collected, and ignores the quality of the people hired |
| quality of hires and cost | the number and quality of résumés and job applications received | indication of the overall effectiveness | better quality resumes may not be translated finally to offers |
| offers-applicants ratio   | the ratio between the number of job offers extended and the total number of applicants | can point out weaknesses                | acceptance is dependent on extraneous variables              |
| time lapsed per hire      | the number of days, weeks, or months taken to fill a position | shorter -> more efficient               | several external and uncontrollable factors, should be used in conjunction |

# Chapter 6 Selection

- selection begins with a pool of suitable applicants created through recruiting
- the selection process: a series of specific steps used to decide which recruits should be hired 

## LO 1

- Successful Execution of an Organization’s Strategy Depends on the Calibre of Its Employees
  - quality and calibre or employees -> effectiveness and success of organization
- An Organization’s Selection Decisions Must Reflect Job Requirements
  - mismatch -> poor hires, lawsuits
- Selection Strategy Must Be Well Integrated with Organizational Priorities 
  - organizational characteristics
- Selection Strategy Must Recognize Organizational Constraints
  - finite resources, need cost-effective systems

## LO 2 - LO 5

### The selection process

1. **preliminary reception of applicants**
   - initial contact
   - preliminary interview for obvious misfits 
2. **applicant screening**
   - the organization will have received a number of résumés or completed job application forms 
   - resumes and job application forms
   - **weighted application blank (WAB)**: some aspects are more related to job success, applicants evaluated for total success score
   - **biographical information blanks (BIBs)**: biodata, personal history and life experiences
     - items must not adversely affect any protected groups of Canadians, must be job-related
     - may be viewed as invasive, turn off qualified applicants
     - results not easily verifiable
     - developed by the organization
   - concern: resume fraud
3. **administration of employment tests**
   - devices that assess the match between applicants and job requirements 
   - written tests/exercises that simulate work conditions
   - **reliability and validity of selection tests**
     - reliability: tests yields consistent results
     - validity: is the test accurately measuring what it is purported to measure?
       - **empirical approach**: relate test scores with a job-related criterion
         - **predictive validity**: giving a test to a group of applicants; test again after the applicants are hired; compare
         - **concurrent validity**: test present employees and correlate scores w/ their performance; no delay
       - **rational approach**: low number of subjects
         - **content validity**: exist when the test contains an adequate and representative sample of items from the domain of the construct that it is attempting to measure
         - **construct validity**: showing that the test measures the construct and only the construct under consideration
     - **differential validity**: valid for a large group, but not for subgroups of minorities or women
     - **validity generalization**: applying validity results amassed from many individual validity studies to guide test choices for a current organization and job
     - **local validation studies**: HR conduct own studies
   - types of tests
     - personality tests
       - measure personality or temperament
       - stable traits
       - designed with psychologically normal, working people in mind
       - big 5 personality factors: conscientiousness, agreeableness, neuroticism/emotional stability, openness to experience, and extraversion
       - linked to ratings of job performance, training performance, absenteeism, and counterproductive work behaviours  
     - ability tests
       - predict which job applicants have the skills, knowledge. and ability to do the job
       - cognitive ability tests: assess memory, reasoning, and verbal and mathematical abilities 
     - knowledge tests
       - measure a person's information or knowledge about job requirements
       - e.g. coding challenge for software engineers
     - performance tests
       - work samples
       - measures the ability of applicants to do some parts of the work for which they are to be hired
       - **situational judgement test**: hypothetical job scenarios, behavioural response
       - **computer-interactive performance tests**: react to a simulation, mental and motor are assessed with high reliability
     - integrity tests
       - honesty tests
       - measures honesty and trustworthiness
       - **overt tests**: direct questions about past thefts
       - **non-overt tests**: respond to questions about their risk-taking behaviours and attitudes toward dishonest behaviours
       - important items may not be testable
4. **employment interview(s)**
   - (immediate) **supervisors**
   - hr: provide supervisor with best applicants available
   - supervisor: decide from above
   - interviewed by several persons (consecutively/panel interview)
5. **realistic job previews**
   - supplement to the supervisory interview
   - allows the potential employee to understand the job setting before the hiring decision is made
   - unmet expectations about a job contribute to initial job dissatisfaction 
   - lower turnover, improve performance, increase job satisfaction, and generate greater trust of the organization
   - adverse effect: more candidates declining job offers when working conditions do not appear appealing
6. **verification of references**
   - personal references - friends or family
   - **employment refereces**: discuss applicant's work history, confirmation of prior employment
   - **reference letters**
     - lack of candour
     - often omitted
   - specialized agencies to conduct background checks
   - use social networking website such as Facebook to learn more about the applicant's interested and behaviours
   - legal obligations
7. **contingent assessments**
   - before the job offer is made
   - e.g. a **medical evaluation**, need to be job related to avoid possible allegations of discrimination
   - **drug tests**
     - assure the absence of steroids and stimulants
     - increases in mortality rates, accidents, theft, and poor performance affect the employer’s economic performance 
     - negative consequences for customers/fellow employees
     - discrimination: drug-dependence = disability
     - employers cannot automatically withdraw offers of employment from candidates who fail alcohol or drug tests without offering accommodation 
8. **hiring decision**
   - single predictor used: easy to determine
   - multiple predictors used: more complex
   - tradeoffs among predictors
     - subjective approach
       - clinical approach
       - subjectively evaluates
       - different decision made by different decision makers - "gut feeling"
     - multiple cut-off approach
       - cut-off scores for each predictor and each applicant evaluated on a pass-fail basis
       - approach is easy to understand
       - deficiency in one predictor cannot be compensated by supeiror performance in another
       - may reject qualified applicants -> poor public relations and possible legal challenges
     - compensatory approach
       - a higher score on a predictor may compensate for a low score on another 
       - add all predictors and look at the total score, take the highest
       - **multiple hurdles approach**: need to pass a predictor satisfactorily before the next one, useful when predictors are expensive (put them later in the process)

### After Selection

- specify probationary period if applicable
- specify start date and terms of employment clearly
- specify reasonable restrictive covenants: confidentiality, noncompete clauses
- ensure that termination procedures are legally enforceable

### Dispositioning of applicants

      - time consuming to develop
      - savings in instructor time, travel, less or no time off the job, better retention, and higher general effectiveness
      - target better
      - effectiveness

### Development

- assume greater responsibilities, power, and authority
- skills: 
  - fundamental skills: the skills needed as a base for further development
  - personal management skills: the personal skills, attitudes, and behaviours that drive one's potential for growth
  - and teamwork skills: the skills and attributes needed to contribute productively

## LO 6

- **strategic human resource development**: the identification of essential job skills and the management of employees' learning for the long-range future in relation to explicit corporate and business strategies
- specific policies and practices
- whom to develop: high future potential from primarily within the management ranks or in key positions
- steps to create employee development plans
  1. assess employee's needs
  2. link competencies and skills to business goals
  3. identify learning and development activities
  4. determine resources
  5. idenify barriers

## LO 7

### Identifying learning and development activities

- **cognitive**
  - **being concerned with altering thoughts and ideas**
  - constant learning and upgrading 
  - least effective
  - passive methods: lectures, seminars, and academic education
  - does little to change behaviour, attitudes, and values
  - increases knowledge and expertise
- **behaviroual**
  - **attempts to change behaviour**
  - making individuals more competent in interacting with their environment
  - has **greater impact** than cognitive
  - **behaviour modelling**: teaches a desired behaviour by a model
  - **the leadership grid**: change dominant management style
  - **sensitivity training**: diagnose group processes and devise solutions to problems, team-building excercises/activities
  - **mentoring**: close relationship
- **environmental**
  - **stategies to change attitudes and values**
  - providing organizational setting where employees can thrive and develop
  - **job rotation**: useful in developing managers
  - **organizational development**: behavioural science knowledge -> planned creation and reinforcement
  - **the learning organization**: employees share ideas
  - **temporary assignments**: management trainees gain valuable special experiences
  - **employee exchange programs**: one-year leave and join another organization
  - **matrix management**: use of different specialists while maintaining functional units, "borrow" staff
  - **project teams**: functional manager has no involvement with the team for the duration of the project
  - **internal consulting**: organizational needs and indevelopment needs together
  - **lateral transfer**: one position to another in the same class (level) but another department
  - **job redefinition/reclassification**: change an employee's job responsibilities, avoid layoff
  - **cross-cultural management training**: work in a different cultural environment
  - **diversity training**: supervisors manage employees from different cultures

### Evaluation

- verify program's success
- 4 types of evaluation criteria:
  1. reaction
     - happiness/smile sheet
  2. knowledge/skill
     - learning aspect
  3. behaviour
     - actions
     - self-reports and observations
  4. organizational results
     - difficult to determine cause-effect relationship
- evaluation methodology 
  - to give participants a test at the end of a training program: is a high score because of the training of because participants are already good
  - pre-test/post-test design: test before and test after
  - **cost-benefit analysis**
    - revenues - cost = profit

### Career planning and development

- ready for career opportunities
- to attract and retain talent
- **career planning**: the process through which individuals become more aware of their interests, needs, and motivations in terms of their job life 
- **career management**: a series of formal and less formal activities designed and managed by the organization to influence the career development of one or more employees 
- **career development**: a lifelong series of activities undertaken by individuals in their pursuit of a career
- **individual career development**: individual employee playing an activie role in managing a career
  - **demonstrate exceptional job performance**: most effective action an employee can undertake, low performers excluded from promotion considerations
  - **increase visibility and exposure within the organization**: being known and hled in high regard, more likely to be considered for an advancement, attained through strong performance
  - **leave the organization to seek a better job**: job hopping; promotion/pay increase/new experience; low commitment and warning sign to future employers
  - **demonstrate organizational commitment**: demonstrate loyalty
  - **seek mentors, sponsors, and coaches**
    - **mentor**: someone who offers informal career advice
    - **sponsor**: someone in the organization who can create career development opportunities for others
    - **coaching**
  - **seek growth opportunities**: working on a project/volunteering/etc.
- measure career success
  - objective & subjective: promotions, status, salary, the development of new skills, work-life balance, challenge, and purpose
  - four general outcomes:
    - **advancement**: the ability to gain a sense of power or status, the ability to develop a positive reputation, ahieve a sense of autonomy and entrepreneur ship
    - **learning**: refers to the acquisition of new skills and competencies that individual's value and see as important in their development
    - **employability**: relates to ing able to make money to survive and have the applicable experiences so that obtaining meaningful work will be possible
    - **psychological** **factors**: psychological factors focusing on internal motivational drivers such as recognition, self-esteem, engagement, satisfaction, and self-actualization

- ensure applicable processes/practivies are developed

#### Encourage Management commitment and support

- manager value development
- evaluate managers on ability to develop their subordinates

#### Devise Communication Plans through HR Tools to Raise Awareness of Career Options

- **job postings**
  - internal job posting process
  - job descriptions and specifications accurately documented and easily accessible
- **career paths**
  - create career paths and link them to training required
  - available for employees to view and follow
  - the next available step
- **career counselling**
  - raise awareness of options
  - onsite counsellors or outsource

# Chapter 8 Performance management 

## LO 1

- **performance management**
  - not just performance appraisal
  - meet individual goals -> contribute to an organization achieving its objectives
  - how to measure is important

- **performance management system goals**
  - linking up approach: individual :arrow_right: organization
  - cascading approach: individual :arrow_right: team :arrow_right: unit​ :arrow_right: division​ :arrow_right: organization
  - the **balanced scorecard**
    - integrates financial measures with other key performance indicators around customer satisfaction, internal organizational processes, and organizational growth, learning, and innovation

## LO 2

- performance appraisals as part of managerial strategy
  - whether employees meeting individual performance goals
  - current skill, experience, performance level
  - performance standards for future requirements
  - purposes:
    - administrative decisions
    - feedback and performance improvement
    - employee development and career planning
    - criteria for test validation
    - training program objectives
    - job re-design
- elements of the performance appraisal system

  - human performance, performance appraisal interview, employee feedback, performance measures, performance-related criteria, human resource decisions, employee records
  - performance standards
  - dependable performance measures: easy to use, be reliable, and report on the critical behaviours that determine performance
  - objective measure vs subjective measure
    - objective: indications of job performance that are verifiable
    - subjective: ratings that are based on opinion or perception, lower accuracy

## LO 3

- considerations for designing an effective performance management process

  1. validity
     - relevance
     - utmost importance
     - invalid -> biased assessments
     - results are the most valid, also job-related behaviours
  2. reliability
     - consistency
     - difficult to achieve because of different raters, instruments, changing work environments
     - *valid criteria tend to be reliable, but reliable criteria are not necessarily valid*
  3. input into system development
     - employee participation
     - more acceptable
  4. acceptable performance standards
     - don't use supervisors' performance standards to access employees
     - need to be derived from a job analysis
  5. acceptable goals
     - often set by managers
     - need to be achievable, not too high
     - derive from the strategic business plans of the organization
     - performance management plan (PMP)
  6. control of standards
     - current assumption: independent
     - but most jobs are highly interdependent
     - standard of performance need to be fully under the control of the employee to be valid
  7. frequency of feedback
     - most once a year
     - challenge: supervisors and employees both busy
  8. rater training
     - trained in observation techniques and categorization skills
     - Frame-of-reference(FOR)
     - be familiar with rating errors
     - minimize erros
  9. ratee training
     - ensure process is well understood and accepted
  10. input into interview process
      - high level of participation in the appraisal interview -> increased employee satisfaction and morale
  11. appraisal consequences
      - effectiveness
  12. different sources (raters)
      - rely on one person -> bisases/rating errors

- comparative evaluation methods

  > colelction of different methods that compare one person's performance with that of a co-workers

  - **ranking method**
    - order of best employee to worst employee
    - cons: subject to the halo and recency effects
    - pros: ease of administration and explanation
  - **forces distributions**
    - sort employees into different classifications
    - cons: forces distribution requires some to be rated low
    - pros: overcome central tendency, leniency, and strictness

- noncomparative evaluation methods

  > do not compare, but uses scales or reports

  - **the rating scale**
    - oldest, most widely used
    - long to high
    - pros: inexpensive to devleop and administer, raters need little training or time to complete the form, and it can be applied to a large number of employees
    - cons: rater's bias, specific performance criteria might be omitted to make the form applicable to a variety of jobs
  - **behaviourally anchored rating scales** (BARS)
    - attempt to reduce the subjectivity and biases of subjective performance measures
    - specific examples along scale
    - critical incidents
    - Behaviour Observation Scale (BOS)
  - **performance tests and observations**
    - a test of knowledge or skills
    - cost of test development
  - **management by objectives** (MBO)
    - each employee and supervisor jointly establish performance goals for the future
    - mutually agreed upon and objectively measurable
  - 360-degree performance appraisals
    - multi-source feedback
    - trend towards this, also trend toward a flatter organization, wider span of control
    - fewer managers having to supervise more employees
    - teamwork and participative management
    - **self-appraisals**
      - defensive behaviour is less likely to occur
      - self-improvement is likely
    - **peer appraisals**
      - more opprotunities to observe behaviour
      - not their "best behaviour" because their boss is present
      - positively impact open communication, motivation, group cohesion, and employee satisfaction
    - **direct report appraisals**
      - evaluate performance of supervisors
      - upward feedback
      - help identify potential leadership or management issues, and are valuable for developmental purporses
  - **assessment centres (AC)** 
    - evaluate employee potential
    - standardized form of employee appraisal, multiple types of evaluation and assessors
    - candidate potential is individually evaluated through in-depth interviews, personal background histories, peer ratings by other attendees, leaderless group discussions, ratings by psychologists and managers, and simulated work exercises
    - procedures: job related?

- implications of the appraisal process

  - training raters and employees
  - rater biases
    - the halo effect
    - the error and central tendency
    - liniency and strictness biases
    - personal prejudice
    - the recency effect
    - contrast errors

## LO 6

- **evaluation interviews**: performance management sessions that gvie employees feedback about their past performance or future potential
  - tell-and-sell approach: reviews the employee's performance and tries to convince the employee to perform better
  - tell-and-listen approach: allows the employee to explain reasons, excuses, and defensive feelings about performance
  - problem-solving: identifies problems that are interfering with employee performance, then remove deficiencies and set goals
- guidelines for effective performance evaluation interviews
  1. emphasize: positive
  2. tell: improve performance, not discipline
  3. provide: feedback
  4. review: performance at least annually
  5. make: criticisms specific
  6. focus: performance
  7. stay: calm
  8. identify: actions to improve
  9. emphasize: willingness to assist
  10. end: positive and how to improve
- establishing a performance improvement plan (PIP)
  1. getting started
  2. develop an action plan
  3. review the performance improvement plan
  4. meet with the employee
  5. follow up
  6. PIP conclusion

# Chapter 9 Compensation management

## LO 1 - LO 4

- objectives sought through effective compensation management
  - acquire qualified personnel
  - retain present employees
  - ensure equity
  - reward equity
  - reward desired behaviour
  - control costs
  - comply with legal regulations
  - further administrative efficiency
- compensation objectives are guidelines
- major phases of compensation management

### 1. Job analysis - identify and study jobs

chapter 2

### 2. Job evaluation - internal equity

- systematic procedures to determine the relative worth or value of jobs
- considers duties, responsibilities, and working conditions
- identify which jobs should be paid more than others
- **job ranking**
  - least precise method
  - rank each job according to its importance in comparison with other jobs
  - overall rankings
  - cons
    - possible that important elements overlooked and unimportant items weighted too heavily
    - do not differentiate the relative importance of jobs: for example, three jobs ranked 1, 2, 3, but the job ranked 1 may be 3 times more important than the job ranked 3
    - lack of precision -> in accurate pay levels
- **job grading**
  - more sophisticated than job ranking
  - not very precise
  - assign each job a grade (e.g. grade I, II, III, IV, V)
  - lack of precision -> in accurate pay levels
- **point system**
  - used more than any other evaluation methods
  - difficult to develop initially
  - more precise, handles critical factors in detail
  - done by job evaluation committee or an individual analysist
  - just usepredetermined job factors
  - 3 steps
    1. determine compensable factors
       - e.g. responsibility, skill, effort, working conditions; 
       - each of these have subfactors
    2. determine level of factors
       - e.g. level I, II, III, IV
    3. allocate points to subfactors
       - if one activity is twice as important as another, it will be asisgned twice as many points
    4. allocate points to levels (degrees)
       - allocate points across each row to reflect the importance of different levels
       - usually: equal point differences, but sometimes variable differences
    5. develop the point manual
       - written explanation
    6. apply the point system
       - determine relative value of each job

### 3. wage and salary surveys - external equity

- discover what other employees in the same labour market are paying for specific key jobs
- generally the local community
- sources of compensation data
  - Employment and Social Development Canada
  - Canadian Human Resource Centres
  - Employee associations
  - Professional associations
  - Private consultants
- cons
  - varying comparability not always sure that their jobs match those reported in the survey, same job title is not enough
  - compare job descriptions

### 4. pricing jobs - matching internal and external worth

- pay levels
  - appropriate pay <-> relative and absolute worth
  - scattergram: plotting the total points and wage level for each key job
- the compensation structure
  - rate range: a pay range for each job class
  - merit raise
    - e.g. $1.00/hr for exceptional performance
    - for when performance appraisals indicate above-average performance

After the four phases: Match (job evaluation worth)

### Challenges affecting compensation

- prevailing wage rates
  - jobs being paid more than relative worth because of market forces
    - demand outstripped supply
    - **red-circled rate**
  - jobs paid less than the established minimum
    - when organization uses salary caps
    - **green-circled**
- union power
  - represents a portion of the workforce, use their power to obtain wage rates out of proportion
-  productivity
  - companies cannot pay workers more than they contribute back to the firm through their productivity
- wage and salary policies
  - examples
    - give nonunion workers the same raise as that received by unionized workers
    - paying a premium above the prevailing wages to minimize turnover or to recruit the best workers
    - cost-of-living clauses
    - **compa-ratio**
      - an indicator of how the salary of an employee relates to the midpoint of the relevant pay grade
      - compa-ratio = salary of the employee / midpoint of the pay grade
      - compa-ratio for groups = average of salaries paid / midpoint of the pay grade
- government constraints
  - Canada Labour Code
  - minimum wages
    - all provinces have minimum-wage legislation
    - Minimum Wags Act 1935
  - contracts with the government
  - staff records
  - criticisms of minimum-wage regulations

### Pay equity

- **pay equity** = equal pay for work of equal value
- equal pay = equal pay for equal work
- how equal value can be measured: skill, effort, responsibility, and working conditions
- reasonable factors that can justify differences in wages:
  1. difference performance ratings
  2. seniority
  3. red-circling
  4. rehabilitation assignment
  5. demotion pay procedures
  6. procedures of phased-in wage reductions
  7. temporary training positions
- suggested measures
  - review policies
  - review recruiting and promotional decisions and track career trends
  - examine by specific position
  - examine by salary grade
  - examine by groups of positions performing work of "relative importance"
  - examine all employee benefits practices
- eliminate inequalities
- large organization: implement employment equity program
- provincial legislation
- the pay-for-performance model
  - clear link between pay and performance / productivity
  - **incentive pay**: directly linked to an employee's performance or productivity (e.g. salesperson commission)
  - better performance is reinforced on a regular basis
  - quick and frequent reinforcement with each paycheque
  - unions often resist incentive systems: fear that management will change the standards to make workers work more

## LO 5

- individual incentive plans

  - **piecework**
    - compensates the worker for each unit of output
    - does not always mean higher productivity
    - group norms may have a more significant impact if peer pressure works against higher productivity
    - many jobs: difficult to measure the person's productive contribution, or cannot control rate of output
  - **production bonuses**
    - incentives paid to workers for exceeding a specified level of output
    - used in conjunction with a base wage rate or salary
    - supplemented by a bonus
    - a variation: rewards employee for saving time
    - combination with piecework: compensating workers on an hourly basis, plus an incentive payment for each unit produced
  - **commissions**
    - salesperson paid a % of the selling price or a flat amount for each unit sold
    - e.g. real estate agents
  - **executive incentives**
    - vary widely
    - young and middle-aged executives: cash bonuses
    - older executives: need for present income is offset by retirement considerations
    - stock options
    - incentive systems that allow executives to design their own compensation package
    - geared to promote long-term performance

- team (or group) base pay

  - team results

    - employee bonuses and salary increases based on team's overall results and are often shared equally

  - production incentive plans

    - groups of workers receive bonuses for exceeding predetermined levels of output
    - short-range, specific production goals

  - profit-sharing plans

    - shares company profits with the workers
    - profitability is not always related to employee performance
    - difficult for employees to perceive their efforts as making much difference
    - reduce effectiveness: diverting the employees' share of profits into retirement plans
    - delayed incentive -> reduced reinforcement value
    - profit sharing plans & open and two-way communication between management and employees
    - in summary, profit-sharing plans contribute to higher motivation and productivity, in conjunction with otehr factors

  - employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs)

    - genuine ownership and voting power when it comes to major decisions relating to the company's future
    - modelled to fit the special needs of a company
      - attract and retain employees
      - motivate employees and improve productivity
      - rescue a failing firm
      - provide a source of additional financing
      - create something for firms to offer in lieu of wage and salary increases

  - cost-reduction plans

    - **scanlon plan**: bases bonuses on improvements in labour costs, as compared with historical norms
    - reduce costs as employees sahre in those savings
    - *Rucker* and *Improshare* plans

  - nonmonetary rewards

    - e.g. praise and recognition
    - can be highly motivational

  - pay secrecy

    | advantages                                           | disadvantages                                                |
    | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
    | most employees prefer to have their pay kept secret  | may generate distrust in the pay system                      |
    | gives managers greater freedom                       | employees may perceive that there is no relationship between pay and performance |
    | covers up inequalities in the internal pay structure |                                                              |

  - 2 major effects

    - lowers the pay satisfaction of employees
    - reduces the employees' motivation to perform (employees tend to overestimate the salaries of their colleagues, causing feelings of unfairnees, inequity, and resentment)

### New approaches to pay

- **skill or knowledge based pay**
  - steps:
    1. requires identification of the tasks that have to be performed in the organization
    2. skills required to compelete the tasks have to be identified
    3. skills have to be priced so that pay rates can be determined
  - horizontal learning of skills
  - learn vertical skills
    - **autonomous work groups**, aka leaderless work groups
    - e.g. Volvo
  - pros: flexibility of the workforce, lead to leaner organizations, multi-tasked employees
  - cons: higher pay rates skill-based pay systems tend to generate
- variable pay
  - improve business performance through changed employee behaviour
  - keep compensation competitive
  - control labour costs
  - e.g. business incentive, special recognition, individual performance, cash profit sharing, stock options, team/group, gainsharing

## LO 7

- total reward model
  - use as rewards of everything an employee values in an employment relationship
- broadbanding
  - assists in flattening large, hierarchical organizations
  - encourages employees to broaden their skills and abilities
  - allows for a more flexible workforce and organization
  - de-emphasizes promotion
  - eases internal transfer
  - supports a new organizational climate
  - simplifies paperwork
- tailor-made perks
  - allow employees to choose their rewards
- international pay
  - international companies
- pay and organizational strategy
  1. motivating performance
  2. identifying valued rewards
  3. relating rewards to performance
  4. setting performance goals
  5. motivations and punishment
  6. motivating skill and knowledge development
  7. fostering attraction and retention

  - **CPP (QPP)** 
    - mandetory for all self-employed persons and employees in Canada
    - contributory plans: both employer and employee pay part of the costs

  - federal and provincial laws specification

## Voluntary benefits

- insurance benefits

  - life insurance
  - health-related insurance

- salary continuation plans

  - paid sick leave
  - **short-term disability plan**: crediting or allocating a certain number of days to an employee, to be used as sick leave for nonoccupational accidents or illness
  - cumulative/noncumulative

- employee security benefits

  - employment income security

    - **severance pay**: if employees have not been given at least two weeks' notice, and if the dismissal was not for just cause
    - **guaranteed annual wage (GAW)**: assure the worker of receiving some minimum amount of work or pay
    - **supplemental unemployment benefits (SUB)**: when employees are out of work, employment insurance benefits are supplemented by the employer from monies previously paid to the SUB fund 

  - retirement security

    - **registered pension plans (PPP)**
      - defined benefits (DB) plans: employee receives a fixed dollar amount as pension, depending on age and length of service, frozen when the employee leaves
      - defined contribution (DC) plans: employer and employee contribute to a pension plan
        - noncontributory: only employer makes the contributions
        - contributory: employee makes a commitment to make regular payments, which are matched by the employer
        - may mean greated benefits, if started early
        - accumulations continue to participate in the accounts' investment, ok to leave company
      - problems
        1. employers go out of business, pension plan unfunded or only partially funded
        2. some companies minimize their pension costs by having very long vesting periods
           - vesting: give workers right to pension benefits even if they leave the company
           - quits/fired before vesting period passed -> no pension rights

    - **pension benefits standard act**
      - regulates pension plans in industries under the jurisdiction of the Government of Canada

## LO 4 - LO 7

- paid time-off benefits
  - time periods during which the employee is not working, but is getting paid

    - increase productivity
    - problem: a tendency to stretch these periods
  - **paid sick leave**
    - most abused benefits
    - some workers: simply extra days off
    - if the human resourcepolicies prohibit employees from crediting unused sick leave to next year’s account, absences increase near the end of the year
    - require medical verfications of illness or pay employees for unused sick leave -> minimize abuses
